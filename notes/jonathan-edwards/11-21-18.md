### Recap

Instead of jumping right into drawing more "ideal worlds", I was struck by a few thoughts:

1. Sean McDirmid was skeptical of my diagnosis of the key hard parts of Reflex
2. You mentioned dogfooding so I wondered what the best approximation of it was to build something better
3. I wanted to get a better sense of the framework before building abstractions on top of it

So my idea was to try and set up a better Haskell/Reflex experience, film myself building things, and then write down complaints. I wasn't able to get a better experience (crazy!) so I went ahead and made a list of key complaints and some next step ideas...

### drawing ideas

* maybe livestream it somehow to encourage me to actually do it?
* think more precisely abstractlbetter distinguish my "vision" from exsiting Haskell alternatives (lamdu, luna, isomorf)
  * the idea of never being able to "delete" anything, nor stop it from running
  * the idea of hashed expressions, particularly with scope
  * exploring which concepts we can move from the language compiler to the editor (no free variables, type inference is just local if not just a type "suggestion")

### Next steps

* p4 next steps
  * read the first 6 chapters of TaPL
  * draw out what a better time would look like
* schedule JE podcast 

### notes from JE

* they have generators in JS so maybe we have laziness and also weak refs maybe
	* TODO ask ryan trinkle
* building a langauge is a lot but a JS framework is great
	* people would immediately download and play with it
* interpreting haskell seems like a lot of work
* starting from the top (the UI like aprt.us) is good
* could start from a DSL for the streams  --> maybe a macro thing for JS or a little lang with syntax and a parser with embedded JS
* he's skeptical of the Xerox parc advice to build one's own infrastructure to build what you want on top
* imagining UI is a pain but implementing is weeks or months of work, but a DSL can give you great sense of the UI and so much easier to build
  * the risks with this is that you'll go with things that are good on paper but hard to visualize
  * tons of DSL tools: spoofax, MPS, look into this for JS
* strongly recommends typescript
  * there's a lot of work on "functional typescript" and some even have typeclasses!
* subtext in the past has been "parametric in my mind", living in multiple places in the design space 


### His work

* minimum viable paradigm
* maybe someone will steal it if it's communicated well enough
* maybe people would join as contributors and could work on parts
* classically, research is stealing idea -- not working with you
* people who cite me is for "inspiration" and I don't get cited in actual research yet because they are not solid enough --> like how Eve inspired Apple
* ultimate goal is to have an impact and what's the best way of doing that?
* I've always avoided making design commitments but now it feels good to settle down 
* think on a time to do a work retreat with JE, maybe Sarah will come
* reminder that PX deadline Feb 1
