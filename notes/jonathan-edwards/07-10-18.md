# Jonathan Edwards 07/10/18

- I was able to “solve” the problem in Reflex. 
    - [http://futureofcoding.org/log#dom-recursion-problem-solved-by-reflex](http://futureofcoding.org/log#dom-recursion-problem-solved-by-reflex) 
    - Hard, types and shit, emacs... worked on emacs setup stuff today 

- They also have ToDoMVC 
    - I mostly understand it 
    - And the code looks like what I was looking for 

- I’m going towards a language (elm) or framework (cycle) or devtool (rxfiddle) 
    - My vague sense is that I need to understand Reflex and then build something with its abstractions 

- I also have this sense that stream combinator visuatializations, like rxfiddle, are key to making FRP understandable 
    - One way to say this: declarative language + GUI on top (HTML, SQL) 
        - Note: PX (shawn mcdirmid), model and UI 

    - Map is straight forward arrows -&gt; 
    - Should I go down the list and try to do this for them all? 

- Don’t want to fight a battle on two fronts, though 
- Also want to think about presenting something at SPLASH 
  
  

- [https://vlhcc18.github.io/](https://vlhcc18.github.io/) 
    - User studies, very academic 

- Go to SPLASH, LIVE (pre) and ONWARD (during) 
    - Less and less practitioners, more researchers 

- Strangeloop is more industry. Cool, neat ideas. More industry. Less research 
    - ICFP is co-located there. 
        - Racket people 

    - Stopped going 

- One way to get oriented is to write up a survey with all the different FRP implementations 
    - Reflex 
    - Elm 
    - Maybe show another one if it’s helpful 
    - Even just one example is enough: just show a problem 
        - Motivating Example 

    - Maybe ToDoMVC 

- Essay 
    - Elm  
        - Motivating example 

    - Reflex  
        - Solved 

    - Hard to use 
        - How to improve with viz? 

    - Link on social media, put on website 

- After 
    - For specific example 
        - What would it look like - mock it up 
        - Storyboard 
        - Don’t worry about general case 

    - Publish this 
    - Bret Victor demo is just build UI for that one example and make video 
        - But what you really want is why it’s hard to generalize 

- And then 
    - Generalize it... 
    - Build a thing... 

- Apply to REBLs 
    - Aug 17 to apply 
    - Concatenate Essay and After 
    - Progression: 
        - Problem 
        - Good semantics 
        - Difficult to edit 
        - How to fix UI? 
        - Here are the technical challenges to building this for real 

- If I don’t make it 
    - PX workshop at &lt;Programming&gt; 
    - [https://2018.programming-conference.org/](https://2018.programming-conference.org/) 

- Co-design - two fronts 
- So hard to go down a bad path 
    - But if you get far enough to show results, you get a seat at the table, people know your name 

  

LIVE and text is hard because sometime the text doesn’t make sense

That’s why structure editing is great for LIVE

  

His work 

- Great quote from urbit 
    - “Current systems are built on principle on half of your brain can be erased.” - at any point you can start from database state and reload into memory. 

- Only really structured editor is Scratch 
    - Simple and laborious 
    - Doesn’t do any refactoring 

- Tried a bunch of approaches 
    - Photoshop one of windows - control panel approach 
    - Meta model approach in Chorus 

- Greenfoot also seems to work, they teach people with it 
- Blockly from EToys and Blockly 
    - I want to do things that aren’t just changing the AST 
        - Such as change the type of something 

- I need a fancier data model than an AST 
    - I have a data model 
    - I have actual data 

  

Hard to do more than 4-5 hours per day of peak creative work and fill in with other things
