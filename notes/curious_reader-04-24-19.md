David Barbour - https://awelonblue.wordpress.com/: 
> RDP is a bidirectional, reactive dataflow model that supports commutative, idempotent, continuous effects on external resources: resource state may be influenced by a set of values. RDP is a logical extension of REST architectural style to influence and effect. The resulting programming model is deeply symmetric and compositional, and enables much equational reasoning.

There are videos of Minskey re: Society of Mind

You can get an iPhone to read you PDFs via their accessibility features

Suggested that improving the Alan Kay Wiki is high leverage. I might want to link to it on Future of Coding.org

http://www.loper-os.org/?p=8. influenced by engelbart, lisp machines. the early stuff is quite accessible.

Dijkstra diaries (he recommended this last time) -- he highly recommends this again. At least 40 of them

Juan Benet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUVLuXjPAfg

I should do Ivan's Jazz course: http://ivanish.ca/lunch-with-alan-kay/ as well as learn to like Opera starting from the first one

(He mentioned how Alan says pop music is a bad thing because you don't need the context and it pleases you it not so good ways.)

Read the Nuerolink article from waitbutwhy

Sci fi / fantasy:

* Culture and Empire: Digital Revolution (he says "you need to read that")
* Otherland from Ted Williams

Watch Ted Talk about Paul McCreedy, or maybe documentaries...

Maybe use ziteboard web app for ipad. Export to SVG which you can add to repo and get diffs on.

He uses Concepts, like me, and exports to SVG for the repo as well. But it's cumbersome, because he also needs to transcribe it manually. He uses "working copy" app to search, but he can't search through those notes.

Re: his tweets to me about Urbit and code as material. He was disappointed on STEPS. No open source code release: just a few papers. In his opinion, he hopes 
Juan and all decentralized people do reproducable stuff: data, paper and code. 

Urbit build modern computing in 30k lines of code a la STEPS. Their stack is amazing. It's worth a reading.

Let's talk about Dynamicland another time... It's too late now...

He mentioned that he wants something for people to collaborate on research, and hopes the decentralized community might make something like that

Listen to Juan Benet Long now foundation talk and web3 summit.
