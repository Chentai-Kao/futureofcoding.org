Brilliant! Abstract mathmatic symbol manipulation was a neccsary evil given that it was *the only way at that time* to *explore mathmatical relationships*. Now that we have computers, we should be able to construct tools better suited to exploring relationships. And in the specific case of physics, we can use simulation tools.

Solving this problem for school math is solving a problem that doesn't exist, given that school math is designed to be hard and annoying.

Solving this problem for "adults" is more interesting. 

> We need to compile a corpus of real, motivating problems â€” problems that people desperately want to explore, but currently cannot.

I wonder if the Mathmatica Langauge is the best solution we currently have to this problem?
