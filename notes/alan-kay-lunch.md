# Lunch with Alan Kay: How to become educated enough to invent the future

Someone (I forget who) mentioned to me at the Dynamicland meetup last month that Alan Kay lives in London. So I dropped him an email. I had sent him a few cold emails in the past, one of which sparked a lively conversation. (I asked him which term he used to describe himself. He landed on "media imaginer" and "communications designer", because terms like "computer scientist" have been opted to mean other things now.)

To my surprise, I got a quick reply and had lunch scheduled for the next week, which was this past Monday, April 15th, 2019 at 11:30am. To my delight and utter exhaustion, we spoke for just over five hours. When my mom saw me later that night, she remarked that I looked "wrung out." It felt like every neuron in my head was firing at full capacity just to try to keep up. I left our meeting out of breath.

_Alan and I after our five hour lunch at the Ivy Cafe in London. Referring to my request for a photo, he said, "It's like game hunting. To show your friends you shot the elephant."_

Before the meeting, I asked a few mutual friends for advice on the meeting. Universally, I was warned that he would do a lot of the talking. This proved to be the case. I later joked to my parents that I got to ask four questions, and each one took him an hour to answer.

Thinking I was clever, I prepared to take notes for the meeting by folding three pieces of printer paper into a little notebook. I was woefully under-prepared in this regard. I expected lunch to go no longer than 2 hours. I ended up using all available space on both sides of the pads. However because of the inane system of paper foldings I used, it took me a while to try and linearize them in Figma:

Most (if not all) of the drawing are Alan's. The text notes are mine. Notes #1 and #2 are what I was hoping to talk about, which we covered maybe 15% of. It was five hours ranging from electrical engineering, to architecture, to the meaning of the word science, to theater, to jazz, to visual art, to education, to researcher gossip, to why to go to grad school, and so, so much computer history. I was doing my best to jot down all interesting key words, even if just to remind myself of the flow of the conversation. 

At no point in our conversation did Alan explicitly explain what his agenda was, or why he even took the time to meet with me. It seemed like he knew almost nothing about me, and wasn't particularly curious to learn. However, from bits and pieces he dropped about *his* mentors, I think I am able to piece together what our lunch was about for him.

Alan admires his former professor Bob Barton. Despite not liking students or teaching, Bob spent the time to do it "for the field." I think that's ultimately Alan's aim in meeting with people like me. Maybe there's a fraction of a percent chance that I have the potential to *help the field* and so Alan was there to nurture that chance. In other words, he was getting lunch with me in for pure benevolence. He wants there to be good people in *his field* (don't ask him what it should be called unless you have all afternoon), ultimately to further humanity.

Also like Bob Barton, Alan spent most of the lunch intellectually destroying me, smacking me around, and pointing out how much more I have to learn in order to do good work. I have met only a handful of people in my life who can give me such brutal criticism but in a way that feels supremely constructive. I could imagine him putting his hand at increasing levels of height, "Normal people are here. People who think of themselves as 'programmers' or 'computer scientists' are here. You probably think you are here, above your peers. But Bret Victor, Vi Hart, and a young me (Alan) are up here. And I (Alan) now am up here. You have a lot of work to do young man, if you want to make it into the big leagues." 

He also gave me a rough blueprint for what it takes to get to his level. "Reading a couple hundred books a year is the bare minimum. It's just the baseline. You also got to be embedded in a community of others who have diverse perspectives to bounce these ideas off of." Alan argued passionately in favor of college and grad school. While he is well aware of its imperfections, he believes it's still better than an "oral culture" or being an autodidact (just following your nose where your curiosity leads you). He recommends that autodidacts institute a "learning enjoyment tax" on themselves: 10% of your learning must not be enjoyable. But ultimately you need a university context to force you to learn what you didn't even realize was worthwhile. It doesn't even matter what you study at university, as long as it's hard, like math, physics, or molecular biology, and the people around you are spectacular. 

What it comes down to is: are you trying to do _science_? Are you trying to invent a good future for humanity? Alan's definition of science is still too large to fit into my head, but I can see his reverence for it and the pioneering scientists of our past. If science is what you're trying to do, you have to be fully committed to walking that road: constantly questioning yourself and everything, working hard to not fool yourself by learning as many different perspectives as possible.

It's only once you give up on absolute truth and certainty that you can make progress. Once you fully recognize your limited and faulty senses, you build tools to get around those limitations. You build models, maps of reality, and then test those models against reality to see how close they come. If you built a good model, and you understand it well in its abstract sense, you can manipulate it and come to understand things about the world. In this way can we get a glimpse of reality, and that's all we ever get. And it's the best thing in the world. It gives us the polio vaccine and spaceships.

For me this lunch felt like a reckoning. Alan clapped his hands loudly in my face, shouting "Wake up! Wake up!", and then turned me away from the flame everyone else was transfixed by and onto a helicopter ride to give me a glimpse of all the other perspectives that I should consider. 

Before this lunch, I thought I was noble in forsaking Silicon Valley riches to achieve non-profit dominance akin to Jimmy Wales's Wikipedia, Mitch Resnick's Scratch, Guido's Python, or Linus Torvald's Linux and git. But Alan showed me how I simply replaced one form of empty, vapid success for another. My admiration of those non-profit tools is "misplaced Darwinism" (a.k.a. "worse-is-better-ism"), equating popularity with goodness. 

Alan disabused me of this dream by tearing down each of my heroes in turn: Wikipedia is factually incorrect more than it is correct, Scratch is Etoys but way worse, and the web was created by amateurs (Tim Burners-Lee was chagrined when Alan confronted him about how its design failed to live up to Engelbart's vision). 

The one technology that Alan has respect for is the internet, a technology that works so well that's it's not even treated as a technology. It's just a part of our natural world now. It's gone through eleven orders of magnitude expansions without a hitch. Yet nobody knows the names of its creators. That's the sign of technology well built.

Alan helped show me that I am professing to be benevolent when I really just wanted to get all the credit for "democratizing programming." It's not so dissimilar from wanting to be rich and famous. 

It seemed like Alan was asking me to pick: how benevolent do you actually want to be? What's your time horizon? Are you looking to make a small incremental improvement and cash in? Or are you looking 10 years out to build a better future for your children? Or are you looking to the 22nd century to ensure that our grandkids' kids will be better than we are? Or are you thinking about the far future of not just humanity but all conscious beings, and how to build a thriving multi-planetary society for millions of years to come?

We so-called computer scientists live in a pop culture. We aren't doing science and we can't tell you a single thing about our history. As a field, we are suffering from a "resource curse": there's too much money in computing and it "dilutes our field with carpetbaggers."" Alan worries that the Silicon Valley mentality of VCs and startups is "soul sealing." Those people may be "lost forever" in an "anti-richness" culture.

It doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to "move fast and break things." We can move slowly and build good things to last. We can return to the traditions of architects that built cathedrals to last hundreds of years, mathematicians who have collaborated on imaginary structures for thousands of years, and scientists who have pulled back the curtain on reality since people began to doubt their senses.

For the few computer idealists among us, we are so lucky to have the legacy left to us by Vannevar Bush, J.C.R. Licklider, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Perlis, John McCarthy, Edsger Dijkstra, John Backus, Ivan Sutherland, and Alan Kay. And those are just some of the names I personally know -- I am now ashamed I don't know more of our history. It's hard to imagine now because they were so effective, but so much of our world's computing prosperity today is due to these people. They imagined the computer as a personal device, a communications device, a device to lift off the burden of tedious mental tabulations. Douglas Engelbart imagined a tool that would aid humanity in dealing with the increasingly-complex problems it faces around the world. We've only seem a glimpse of that vision, but we need it now more than ever.

So practically, what does this mean for me? Alan also said at lunch that one problem young people make is "having goals." It's too early to have goals because young people don't even know what they don't know. I think that kind of epistemic modesty is a great idea. In other words, I want to really take to heart Alan's suggestion to become "educated" in a much broader sense than I previously thought was even possible, let alone desirable. I see now that the more perspectives I can acquire, the better I'll be at not fooling myself, and the more I'll be able to appreciate the richness of the world.

I also want to think a bit more critically about my "theory of change." I'm currently operating under the lone-programming-language-developer-open-source theory of change that worked for Linus, Guido, Matz, Burners-Lee, etc. However, Alan pointed out that most technologies created in this way are "worse is better" ones. The best technological innovations happened in in-person teams. Of course, maybe the internet will allow these innovations to happen physically distributed, but that remains to be seen. At the very least, I am now way more curious about what made ARPA, Bell Laps, and Xerox Parc succeed. I'm also going to more closely follow what Juan Benet is up to, because he's been talking in this Alan-Kay-style for years now.

What surprised me most about the meeting was how compelling Alan was. Before this meeting, I saw him as a researcher or engineer, in many ways similar to myself. I didn't realize that his main role has been recognizing, collecting, nurturing, leading and inspiring researchers. He played my emotions like a fiddle. He weaved a web of tales of the greatest story of humanity -- our struggle to elevate ourselves -- and implied that I could play a part in that story, too, but only if I get serious about my education.

## Transcribed Notes (very messy)

They are mostly in a haphazard order. I am mostly to blame for this, but Alan does wander when he talks...

* Papert is top 10 educator of 20th century but not top 5, like Montessouri
* Need to design hardware for software because software is all that matters -- so you can build better optimizations for the software, instead of trying to get your high level language to pretend to be C to run on an Intel chip.
* "idealists who can do engineering"
* In 30 seconds, Alan realized BV is the "real deal" and would need a whole group of his own
* If I don't believe it, I can't see it.
	* Recognizing vs seeing
	* Drawing = science. Killing off sense of perception (Monet)
	* 7 is when kids nail down reality into words (categories), age of majority in Middle Ages
* Alan spent a couple weeks reading McLuhan to better bond with his professor Bob Barton. He found _Gutenberg Galaxy_ a slightly easier entry point than _Understanding Media_.
* Alan had "given up on education before he met Seymour"
* Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner used to follow McLuhan around, sitting in his hotel rooms while he was smoking a cigar in bed.
	* McLuhan, like Kay, is known for his 1-liner quips
	* Instead of engaging with peoples' arguments, he try another quip on them. "Let's try this one."
	* He was doing *art* in the true sense of "waking people up"
		* Quick remembering, believing
		* Reason form first principles
* McLuhan studied ad men, not Behaviorist psychologist because he wanted the people who studied humans, not white mice
* "You can't understand the Wealth of Nations, without Adam Smith's first book."
* Art was the ad medium of the Renaissance
	* who can afford to feed artists gets to direct the art
	* you can argue about many things with stained glass, but not democracy
* "I still advocate people go to college. It's almost useless, but still better than an oral culture." 
* Maxwell was the smartest guy in the 19th century
* Newton wasn't a Newtonian
	* He didn't confuse his map with reality, because he didn't believe in action at a distance
	* If the distance of an object changed, it would cause the force of gravity to instantaneously change
	* He *invented* his laws of gravity one summer he was escaping the plague at age 26, to make sense of Kepler's ellipses, which he saw were an inverse square relationship
* McLuhan saw that what was interesting about reading wasn't what you learned but what had to happen to your mind in order for you to read. It wasn't about outsourcing memory or transmitting data. It was about creating a fluid mind.
	* Initially it was just to transfer oral culture ideas
	* Eventually it was co-opted for longer things, to be re-read, in more detail (mathematics, argumentation, logic, democracy)
* "I don't think in terms of slogans"
	* And McLuhan probably didn't either 
* McLuhan converted to Catholicism
* Nobody unpacks the slogans
	* A point of view could be worth *negative* 80 IQ points
	* The best way to predict the future includes inventing a *bad* future 
	* A slogan is just a big word (category)
* McLuhan dreaded the global village we have today
* Alan spends 40-00 hours to prepare 1 hour talk
	* Throwing the best parts away
	* And creating metaphors and slogans
* Alan learned to write for a more popular audience for his Scientific American piece
* One way to deal with identity is to ignore the past
	* You need to put your identity someplace else to get the criticism you need
	* Autodidacts follow their own nose which is exactly wrong
		* You need to be forcibly put through things or be a baby
		* “To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child. For what is the worth of human life, unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by the records of history?” - Cicero
	* Parents don't pay attention to identity formation
	* Montessori did
	* What is "computer science"? (Answer: the study of all phenomenon related to computers.) Who is Douglas Englebart? (Wrong answer: inventor of the mouse.)
		* Any CS person who doesn't know is not actually part of the field
		* It's a sign CS is a pop culture
		* Misplaced Darwinism, believing that what exists now is better
			* There's not even a decent web WYSIWYG tool like they had at PARC
			* Nor what we now call "live coding"
* Noticing curriculum
	* They want to shake up kids' beliefs in reality without turning them into psychological wreaks
	* Real thinking is like learning to ice skate, you fall on your ass a lot at first but then you go way faster than walking
	* They gave kids microscopes in part to slow them down and get Khaneman's System 2 to kick in
	* The whole point of the Exploratory is to show kids the world is not as it seems

	* Vi Hart is a lot like that
	* BV is more like Engelbart, which a messianic thing
	* BV never got the way Vi communicated
	* ideas are light/radiation, not matter so many can exist in the same place at the same time (Maxwell, superposition)
	* **good designers keep mutually contradicting ideas in their head without trying to resolve them, because good problems require real pondering and you don't want to tie up your degrees of freedom prematurely**
* Alan reached out to Vi to ask about her process for making math videos
	* When he heard Khan Academy's funding wasn't working out, he hired her
	* It took her 40 hours to produce a 1 minute video
	* 4-5 weeks for a video
	* 6 months for a 30 min video
	* She did the soundtrack first, like Disney, with storyboards
	* She's the cloests thing to an alternative TV
	* Vi was trained as a composer; her dad was a mathematician
	* Jaon Lanier is now funding Vi, which is great
* Alan Kay is happy with people going to trade schools, but they shouldn't be able to vote
* Most people think they want to learn B, but what they really need is a C they didn't even know about, and you only get that from amazing people (not necessarily with superior intellect)

	* you need chops first
* Alan's self-described story is "curiosity and richness of art"
*  haha, aha, ahhhhh (comedy, science, art)
	* pun is the simplest form of art
	* art has something to do with 7 plus or minus 2
	* the method acting is egotistical. in England it's all about the audience
	* Arthur Miller is too didactic. Theater is the "magic mirror" that helps people be reborn in an area of humanity

* symbols without definitions: placeholders. The most important concepts
	* Jungian idea
	* Prolog had this, best part
* The hardest problems you don't know how to solve right now
	* require strategies, not algorithms

* there's incrementally better, then there's what's needed, and then way up there's perfect
	* key is picking the lowest thing above wht's needed
* VC and startups are "soul sealing"

* He claims to have predicted the Valley's real estate boom and encourage Google to buy up all the land when it was cheap

* BV's Dropbox talk happened hafter Alan yelled at BV for not knowning enough about Engelbart

* Computer degree is too easy. 
* Physics is hard and good.
	* You can't tell stories about electrons. The electrons won't go along with it.

* drawing is about seeing
	* you can create a low pass filter by looking between two fingers
	* you draw faces by comparing them to faces you know how to draw

* you can reach scale by using metaphors to things that scale like biology or international diplomacy
* email was first done via timeshare at OS level, they even had chat who could tell you who was online

* if we were to redo the web: we'd need to make the kernal as simple as possible
* they key is just to allocate memory and processing, and protect other memory and processing 
* Smalltalk protected through encasulation 
* Dave Reed, late 70s seperated TCP/IP so you could replace TCP with UDP or FTP, for example
	* he also did "active objects" and "pseudotime", which is a great idea, better than seamphors
* The Berkely file system is an extension of TCP: treat files as internet entities

* At Xerox PARC, they came up with a printer file format, but realized it wouldn't work because of the "degrees of freedom problem"
* Two guys (Tom and Michael?) came up with TAM, which is resolution independce programming language for graphics
* Xerox pushed them out and one of them created Adobe and turned TAM into postscript, which is a PL sent to printers
* It's like an ambassador that negotiaties meaning between compute and printer
* It still uses Ivan Sutherlan's teachings of matricies to compute this stuff
* We could reinvent the web with "display postscript"
	* Use the same langauge for printers as for screens: would need new kinds of GPUs
* An internet-y smalltalk would be Objects/IP (instead of TCP/IP)

* The Scientists Journey
	* Once you give up on truth and certainty, then you can begin to make progress
	* Once you realize how faulty and limited your senses are, especially your sense of reasoning, you start building tools to get around your limitations
	* Then you build models, maps of reality and you can test those models, maps against reality and see how close they come.
	* And if you have a good model, and you understand it well in its abstract sense, you can manipulate it and come to understand things about the world
	* In this way we get a mere glimpse of reality, and that's all we ever can get
	* And it's the best thing in the world. It gives us the polio vaccine
