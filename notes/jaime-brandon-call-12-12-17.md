* Coding is not the new literacy
  * Where Jaime and Chris agree 
  * Chris thought models should already be entirely intuiative. Should be able to write things down without any training.


* feedback
  * blockly replacement
    * who would actually use this?
    * semi-structured is good
      * like google email search
      * broken states are useful on the way to the next valid state
    * (note to self: look into the new editor thing that the guy who made codemirror)
    * not highest leverage thing to work on. language improvement is highest expected value
  * FRP Scratch
    * who is the user?


* at eve
  * goal was too general
  * user was too broad
  * does not prioritize any one design over another
  * difficult to make a decision, agonizing over each one
  * constantly stuck at each branch in the road
  * need a bunch of use-cases, users, problems, principles
* really nice to have a customer
  * they are going to have a consulting side of the company 


* how he got job at Eve
  * they rejected him in interview, but then got along well at conference
