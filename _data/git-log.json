I feel very lucky to get his advice.\n\nI updated him on my progress, that I was able to solve [DOM Recursion Problem with Reflex](http://futureofcoding.org/log#dom-recursion-problem-solved-by-reflex), but haven't made much progress on the UI part of visualizing the stream operators yet.\n\nHe was able to give me really great advice here, because he's potentially the original guy who's been insisting that we need to work both on the model and the UI at the same time - as opposed to PL people who only work on the model and Bret Victor people who only work on the UI. It's called co-design, desigining two different pieces towards each other.\n\nHe suggested that before I work on the UI, I should write a blog comparing Reflex to Elm, why I like the Reflex semantics as a model better, why the UI of Haskell is hard to use and why we need a better UI, and only vaugely hand-wave about how I think the UI will look.\n\nThis essay will be a great foundation to build off of. I'll share it on social media, HN, etc.\n\nI started the [essay today here](/drafts/frp).\n\nThen, I should pick a few very specific and small examples, and draw out by hand and Figma what they should look like from a storyboarded perspective, not worrying too much about the general case. I can then publish this as a follow up essay. However, Jonathan warned me (and I agree) that this will likely be difficult, possible where this research thread comes to an end, so we'll see...\n\nHowever, if I am able to get something that looks promising, I should, in effect, concatenate the two essays into a single narrative and submit to either LIVE or REBLS at SLASH on Aug 17th. In particular, Jonathan noted that I should explain in my submission the \"technical challenges for building this for real.\"\n\nIf I don't make it in time for SPLASH, the next relevant workshop would be PX at <Programming> in the Spring of 2019, which is very far away, so I hope I make it in time!", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1531330532, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531330528, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "69b8efa3c52dd57d2367dab50c07207cbd3c00c2", "parents": ["f5d275209ba8340603d86df8f601e147ad443306"], "commit": "1a0f1791ee3f21cb142fa500b489109949f1fb9b", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1531330528, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531330528, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "b6a338b884aea404e53788612e02be03a0970f47", "parents": ["f763f385c6674b15baca1d553d9f4d9395cbd805"], "commit": "f5d275209ba8340603d86df8f601e147ad443306", "message": "started frp essay draft", "changes": [[53, 0, "drafts/frp.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1531325899, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531325895, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "7d3fea916780a913a106feff4f29315eb861489e", "parents": ["c4bded134ca3b0a26d9fa39010333b0ee80dd603"], "commit": "f763f385c6674b15baca1d553d9f4d9395cbd805", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1531325895, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531325895, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "3af056953346b39b1a5f10c67a295e81a0aff9d9", "parents": ["6000c35878fe81bb62f9fc2a18a5296ecab7db9d"], "commit": "c4bded134ca3b0a26d9fa39010333b0ee80dd603", "message": "created drafts folder, moved essays, and fixed broken links", "changes": [[16, 0, "404.md"], [52, 0, "drafts/app-idea.md"], [175, 0, "drafts/casual.md"], [77, 0, "drafts/customer-support.md"], [51, 0, "drafts/invented-or-discovered.md"], [59, 0, "drafts/learnable-programming.md"], [38, 0, "drafts/legal-code.md"], [60, 0, "drafts/power.md"], [41, 0, "drafts/regex-for-humans.md"], [116, 0, "drafts/visual.md"], [0, 52, "essays/app-idea.md"], [0, 175, "essays/casual.md"], [0, 77, "essays/customer-support.md"], [0, 51, "essays/invented-or-discovered.md"], [0, 59, "essays/learnable-programming.md"], [0, 38, "essays/legal-code.md"], [0, 60, "essays/power.md"], [0, 41, "essays/regex-for-humans.md"], [2, 0, "essays/sissies.md"], [0, 116, "essays/visual.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1531324765, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531324761, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "cc11f808f9583178da1e7f80183b509589cd2eee", "parents": ["0c5f40d955bd670a35d641580709eae3968a2780"], "commit": "6000c35878fe81bb62f9fc2a18a5296ecab7db9d", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1531324761, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531324761, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "204a936084950d1fbc2d5d89d23b9e79b818929f", "parents": ["fad129a4fc7e098935f750920ba766849c97e1e0"], "commit": "0c5f40d955bd670a35d641580709eae3968a2780", "message": "refactored 'past research' to 'essays' section", "changes": [[1, 4, "index.html"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1531151108, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531150988, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "2ab2464ef5ba2168569d4eaf3c33388d45d8d942", "parents": ["0867ce8699a7a7121d8e941263170320b409ac7e"], "commit": "fad129a4fc7e098935f750920ba766849c97e1e0", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1531150988, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1531150988, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "e267d3f14b68e4238e02307d541dac0abb485aa1", "parents": ["4aea428f5bc3a003a6ada5b65ee257d868fb6453"], "commit": "0867ce8699a7a7121d8e941263170320b409ac7e", "message": "## Added Reflection 12\n\nIt's been a while since I reflected on my work here.

He's working with normal batch code (mostly static input, mostly static output), like data processing, while I'm working with reactive code (which responds to inputs over time), like user interfaces. So my problem is strictly more difficult - possibly even a superset - and is *ever harder*, because I want to allow higher order streams (streams of streams).\n\nSo it occurs to me: why start with the harder problem? We still as an industry haven't solved the easier problem. If I want to do simple data processing, I don't have any satisfactory options. The easiest to use is probably Excel / Google Sheets, but that's a pain and limited. And then there's Jupyter or ObservableHQ, but those are a nightmare in all sorts of errors and slow feedback loops.\n\n### Let's visualize all the FP list operators!\n\nMy first thought was to create metaphoric and live visualizations of all the FP list operators in Figma, such as map, filter, fold, find, some, etc. My thesis here is:\n\nAll list (or stream) operators have highly visible structures that programmers have to simulate in their heads. Why don't we bring those mental visualizations out onto the computer screen as the actual interface? WYSIWYG for list manipulation!\n\nFor example, here's map:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/42383185-84a45440-8104-11e8-930e-c260cc8c6ced.png)\n\nThis is literally how functions are taught in school to children. They are a mapping from a domain to a range. Arrows from one list to another. And you could imagine actually writing the map function on any of the arrows and seeing the data update through the arrows.\n\nFor the fuzzyset problem I’m working on, the visual representation I have in my head is something like:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/42387500-6b5db632-8110-11e8-9c75-2e8222f3f4a1.png)\n\n(It was prettier in my head.)\n\nHowever, I was discouraged when I went to the [lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10) to see how many of these I'd have to make. Part of my thesis is that there are only a few key primitives you need to do anything you want with lists. (While this is technically true because all you need is fold, it's likely not true when you consider our mental visualizations of these operators: they are more specific. For example, it'd be difficult to detect that I'm doing a map with `foldr (\\x xs -> x+1:xs) [] [1,2,3]` to get it to expand to the arrows viz above. Ditto with filter, etc.)\n\nHowever, this isn't a showstopper. Just because there are a couple dozen (maybe even ~100) operators doesn't mean I should go home. It's actually a simple-ish project if I want to commit to it. Here are a few questions I have:\n\n1. What about nested combinators? A filter inside a map? A map inside a fold? What about both? Look at this crazy code:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/42384858-28c12ea0-8109-11e8-81b9-78fa6787d0e8.png)\n\n2. How do you visualize the current values of computations within the body of lambda functions? Maybe this isn’t a real problem (as long as you have concrete data to flow through), or maybe it’s the same problem as (1) above.\n\n3. What about user-defined functions? Do they write their own visualizer?\n\n4. Are the FP combinators the essence of list (or data) combinatorics? What about APL? Sometimes nested lists and maps within lists seem cumbersome. What about SQL?\n\n### How about Luna-lang?\n\nI did not have fun with Luna, despite it being squarely centered in all the things I’m into: Haskell, visual coding, live data. For one, Luna only visualize dependencies between values, which are much less rich than I’m thinking in terms of specific metaphoric pictures for each combinator.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/42385339-7be3cf4c-810a-11e8-93a4-d4f605ab0482.png)\n\nSecondly, it’s not nearly as live as I’d want.\n\n### How about a spreadsheet?\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/42385591-32d183a2-810b-11e8-8603-7cd785a77aa4.png)\n\nIt was easy to normalize the string (except the regex wasn’t compatible, so that part needs work).\n\nThere’s no `range(10)` function, so I had to create the series by dragging down `+1` of the previous number manually, which won’t scale. I’m not sure how to get around this.\n\nI was surprised to see that there are named ranges now which are similar to variables. The names don’t show up on the sheet (I had to add them manually above as a label) but you can use them in formulas. I did this with `value`, `normalized`, and `gramSize`, but got bored and stopped after a certain point.\n\nSplitting into grams as a mapping was very straight forward (except that there’s no substring and I had to use `LEFT` and `RIGHT` - it’s a bummer there’s no function creation either).\nGrouping and counting was funny - I actually used the `Query` function which is very SQL-like. It worked like a charm, except it didn’t keep the original ordering, which was a bummer. (You can see the query in the bottom of the sheet.\n\nIn order to try to keep the order, I pulled the counts back up into the original grams list. This works, but then there are duplicates of course. I guess I could first remove the duplicates and then join with the counts, but I didn’t do that.\n\nOverall, it’s possible to do stuff in a spreadsheet, but:\n\n* the cell position references are the worst (always breaking things)\n* you need to dynamically creating ranges (not by dragging down)\n* you need user-defined functions\n* you need to see both the data and the formula at the same time\n* you need to be able to visually see the relationships between cells without looking at formulas\n* you need to be able to export your process to code that can run as a library\n\n### What about Flowsheets?\n\nI haven’t had the chance to play with it myself, so I don’t really know, but it looks great. I’d prefer a FP language instead of Python, but doesn’t really matter. I’d be curious how it handles nested data structures.\n\n### What about APL?\n\nI spend ~3 hours yesterday on replicating this code in APL. God it was hard!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/42386185-c44df03a-810c-11e8-836f-da12c5068964.png)\n\n[Here’s a link to it on tryapl.](https://tryapl.org/#?a=%7B%u237A%2C%u2262%u2375%7D%20%u2338%20%7B%27-mississippi-%27%5B%u2375%5D%7D11%203%u2374%u2283%2C/%7B%u2375+%u23733%7D%A8%AF1+%u237311&run)\n\nIt took a very long time, it was very frustrating, I barely understand how the code works, and I am still not quite done. I haven't figured out how to abstract over arbitrary word inputs which would allow me to remove the '-mississippi-' string and hardcoded 11's and 3's.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints about APL is the documentation. It's like it's written in another language! And I wasn't able to find great Stack Overflow support.\n\nI’ve printed out Iverson’s Turing lecture on APL so maybe reading that will help. I’m dying out here!\n\n### The grass is always greener - yet again\n\nI tried to jump ship (again) to a different problem. I thought maybe it would be easier and help with my intended problem, but *surprise* it’s difficult in its own right.\n\n### Todos 7/6/18\n\nI’m not sure where to go from here... I’m feeling as lost as I did in [my last todos](http://futureofcoding.org/log#next-steps-6218).\n\nI guess learning Reflex and building visualizations for it (in Figma to start) is a good next step.\n\n(As an aside, I spent about an hour yesterday learning about PureScript which was fascinating. It compiles to readable JS! It does this by not being lazy. The author has a FRP library called Behaviors that’s just ~100 lines of code.

I'm waiting on some notes from a friend before posting it around.\n\n### [A Human-Readable Interactive Representation of a Code Library](http://glench.github.io/fuzzyset.js/ui/)\n\nI needed a break, so I read through Glen's new essay, in part because its topic is excitingly similar to my own. There's a lot he says that now I no longer have to say myself - I can simply quote him. In fact, I think this essay could provide me with the \"intellectual cover\" from which to begin my own essay - which would allow me to do away with contexualizing why code comprensibility is important.\n\nI also had fun converting some of his code to an FP style, which allowed me to make some points about why the model is important, along with shwoing the data. I've included the email I sent to Glen:\n\n#### Email to Glen, Fuzzyset & FP\n\nHey Glen,\n\nI took some time today to dig into your Fuzzyset explanation. It's wonderful! In particular, I love the little details, such as providing links at the very button numbers that show the calculations of the dot product and magnitude in a popup.\n\nThe second interactive section of your essay, \"Turning a string into a vector\", features some code that incredibly difficult to comprehend, even with the explanation and GUI beside it. As an exercise I removed the incidental complexity in the code (in other words, converted it to a functional style) to clear things up:\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/stevekrouse/7d4c4d593fe4c97014df594429217aa4.js\"></script>\n\nNow you can better follow the logical flow of the code - as opposed to the control flow of the computer. This includes eliminating iteration variables, in fact all mutable variables, which eliminates bugs, such as [a 5-line section that doesn't appear to do anything](https://gist.github.com/stevekrouse/e4c6d782144539907fc30400438243f9#file-fuzzyset_gramcounter-original-js-L7-L11). (Please correct me if I'm wrong.) It also is shorter now: the core of the code is 13 very clear lines (excluding comments).\n\nAdditionally, in this form, you don't need your comments on the side (about normalizing the string and adding dashes) because I've added them in context, which makes it even easier for a user to tweak them.\n\nAnd perhaps the best part of the functional style isn't captured by the code: it's quite visualizable in a way that doesn't require console.log. Each line of code is a constant value, mapped from a previous value. In it's current form I can imagine it being directly converted to something like Flowsheets, and you could marry the abstract symbols and concrete values even further. Dream, here we come!\n\nBest,\nSteve\n\n### Continued Casual, comprehensible, visual essay\n\n[Here's the current status of the outline.](https://gist.github.com/stevekrouse/dd90cbee71e0628fc71f3bff1ec708af) It's tough. It's pretty messy. As I said above, I may use Glen's essay as a starting place and just jump into comprehensibility and reactive programs, and not contextualize why those things are important. At the end of the day, my vision of everyone constantly improving and customizing the software they use as the use it for free, while very compelling for me, is less so for others who have less of the picture in their heads.", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1530718925, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530718922, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "0ef1eaf7c7cab184653e4d2dca16090a05b05ffc", "parents": ["7dadf315a5b867d1b3ac0a7152cac61f19f010d6"], "commit": "659bd2605801f7a5436c129b278c93cc42f43c56", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530718922, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530718922, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "1050b0d95de94d2cc7946f1dec3a8839332eb7ec", "parents": ["4cadd9a8907a09bab8d900dd5988345cee159fd7"], "commit": "7dadf315a5b867d1b3ac0a7152cac61f19f010d6", "message": "first stab at new rant", "changes": [[66, 0, "essays/sissies.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530635599, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530635527, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "360a785488c8430fe40c91118b05a9d3afd64603", "parents": ["b0d185620843bd6ca90b62a9390bc3653e4c9819"], "commit": "4cadd9a8907a09bab8d900dd5988345cee159fd7", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530635527, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530635527, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "55c64dfa779fc87c53e00a72c3c27c033721e80e", "parents": ["cd4536bd4f59fd864ea420acd464d19afc034924"], "commit": "b0d185620843bd6ca90b62a9390bc3653e4c9819", "message": "## Added 26, Glen Podcast\n\nIt took me ~1 hour to edit the podcast and ~20 minutes (I timed it) to put it online, including uploading it, writing the description, links, etc. This is one of my favorite conversations so far!", "changes": [[45, 0, "episodes/26.md"], [1, 0, "index.html"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530569970, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530569948, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "ef1da195e52900a134d3098630489d6ed73f9e5d", "parents": ["5daea83ac3d8989dbecee34a6c814f5db7c6caa3"], "commit": "cd4536bd4f59fd864ea420acd464d19afc034924", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530569948, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530569948, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "97c7e73d52dc08246f2b325e251d6cd22ef55ba5", "parents": ["97f5dba2de0a9ae255e3e5641ab261cd997408e5"], "commit": "5daea83ac3d8989dbecee34a6c814f5db7c6caa3", "message": "## A tad lost in FRP Land\n\n* TOC\n{: toc }\n\nUnfortunately, Thursday was a bit of a bust. I went to the Games for Changes conference but didn't get inspired. I imagine that'll be the case for most conferences - unless they're _nonferences_, which is basically a conference without talks and focuses on peer-to-peer interactions.\n\n### Fall 2018 conferences\n\nSpeaking of nonferences, the tickets for CycleJSConf 2018 go online today and they only have 40 spots so I should decide about that ASAP. It looks like a long an expensive flight, so I'll have to think on it... As an aside, my girlfriend and I are thinking about moving to London in the next few months, in which case it's cheap and a 2 hour flight. But then it'll be harder to get back to the States for Splash in Boston in early Nov.... These conferences are complicated and expensive!\n\n* Sep 26-28 Strangeloop (and elm-conf) St. Louis\n* Oct 17-19 CycleConf Copenhagen\n* Nov 4-9 SPLASH Boston\n\n### A fourth vision-y essay\n\nI spent 2 hours on Friday (before I had to go to Philly for my grandfather's birthday) on yet another vision-y essay. This one is about how the smallest unit of improvement a person can make in technology is an app, and how that's too big, especially when people mostly just want to add on to existing apps with a feature or customization.\n\n### Casual, comprehensible, visual essay\n\nAt this point I have 4 such essays:\n\n1. [Apps are too big as a unit of improvement](/essays/app-idea)\n2. [People will (learn to) improve software if it's not too hard](/essays/power)\n3. [Software needs to be casually improved](/essays/causal)\n4. [In order to be casually improved, it needs to be visual](/essays/visual)\n\nAnd starting on Wednesday, I've been maintaining a Workflowy nested list of the \"outline\" of this massive essay / thought dump. Workflowy felt like the right tool for this because I'm making a linear argument with a lot of tangents and nested points, and I want to be able to zoom in and out on the sub-points as well as collapse arguments to see the broader shape. The Workflowy is not on source control, so I put [the current version of it in this gist](https://gist.github.com/stevekrouse/626422d9c0e99629afda2a227374911c), and [here's a link to the live one](https://workflowy.com/s/BeQ_.L6nCI8NokW).\n\nFor better or for worse, these ideas keep metastasizing and gobbling up other projects into their purview. For example, on Friday I re-read [the final STEPS report](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2012001_steps.pdf) as well as Guido's [Computer Programming for Everybody](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/), the second of which I found from watching [@roml's Liberal Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3nJR7PNgI4). All three projects were highly related and I copied and pasted lots of their text into the Workflowy for reference.\n\nI also sent an email to @roml, asking for help articulating the vision for \"liberal software.\" It's a fascinating vision. In particular, I want to clarify how it's different from the Smalltalk, Lively Kernal, Morphic, STEPS, Boxer vision of a unified computing environment. Maybe it's not different from those, but it feels different. For one, I'm more concerned with web-based tools, while those are more OS based. For another, I care a lot about the visual polish of the end software, while those almost deliberately seem to not.\n\nI'd love to zoom in on a sub-topic of my outline and write / polish that concept well so I can publish it, get it out there, but I am finding that easier said than done. I'm also becoming cognizant of how long this writing is taking me, and am worried that it's not the best use of my time... Maybe I should go back to the problem as opposed to motivating and contextualizing the problem.\n\nOn the plus side, I've become skilled enough in communicating what I'm working on and why that yesterday I was able to explain it at a party (in conjunction with Nadia's [Independent Researcher article](https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research)). Additionally, both Jonathan Edwards and Paul Chiusano sent me a shockingly relevant paper that came out a few days ago,  discussed below, which is a great sign that people understand where my head's at.\n\n### Reading & Watching on 6/2/18\n\nI worked from 9:20-2:00 today, had a 45 min break for lunch, and have been working on this write up for the last hour or two. Productive day! (Although it doesn't really feel it because I don't have much tangible to show for it.)\n\n#### [Debugging Data Flows in Reactive Programs](http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/files/38856517/paper.pdf)\n\nThis is the paper both Paul and Jonathan sent me, which came out a few days ago. I haven't felt this sinking feeling of \"oh shit someone already beat me to it\" in a long time, which is a great sign.\n\nOn note I'll make up front: the reasoning in this paper feels backwards to me. It's saying: people use FRP, it's hard to debug FRP with imperitive debuggers, so let's make visual debuggers. However, I feel that the visualizations are the key to why FRP should be used in the first place, and the fact that we don't already have good visualizations for it crazy.\n\nThey focus on the [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) library in this example. To be honest, I had considered doing something similar myself, so it's great to see this before I did that. This means that they do visualize streams of streams, but not cyclic streams.\n\nThey also focus a lot on the user interviews, which I find silly, like they're pretending to be a different kind of science than they are.\n\nI speak more about their visualizer, rxfiddle, below in the \"FRP Visualizations\" section.\n\nI find it hilarious that they include a reference to [StoryFlow](http://www.ycwu.org/projects/infovis13.html), a tool to visually track the evolution of a character in a fictional story. It's funny to be because I've been using the [metaphor of fiction](http://futureofcoding.org/essays/casual#reading-fiction) as an example of how it's difficult to follow state in imperative languages.\n\nThey also cited a bunch of papers at the end of their paper that extolled the importance of seeing runtime values in order to comprehend programs, which fits into my thesis nicely. Currently you have to instrument your code manually or set debug breakpoints to inspect. I want you to be able to look with your eyes, mostly, and interact only a bit to see what's up in a program.\n\n#### [Functional Reactive Programming, Continued](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=581695)\n\nAfter reading the above paper which focuses on rxjs, I felt my understanding of \"true FRP\" shaken a bit. I often find it hard to keep them all straight in my head, so I read this article in part to see if I could figure it out.\n\nThis was an arrowized paper. It helped me get back into the mindset of FRP, but no great insights here.\n\n#### [Monadic Functional Reactive Programming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262292005_Monadic_Functional_Reactive_Programming)\n\nI was in the groove, so I continued on. This article was fascinating, but a bit hard to read because I'm slightly allergic to monads. It was interesting to see that he explicitly says he wasn't able to do \"mutually dependent signals.\"\n\n#### [Practical Principled FRP](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.724.7758&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\n_Forget the past, change the future, FRPNow!_\n\nThis paper is apparently the basis for Hareactive/Turbine (discussed more below) and builds upon Monadic FRP. It seems to solve space/time leaks with some clever restrictions about what you can and cannot depend upon. However, as many monadic interfaces do, this feels very imperitive to me. They have a `Now` monad for goodness sake!\n\nAt the end, they make an tantalizing point that \"synchronous dataflow langauges, such as Lustre, Esterel and Lucid Synchrone\" ... never have a issue with leaky abstractions, even for higher-order dataflow, because they are more restrictive than traditional FRP\" - but he doesn't say in which ways they're more restrictive.\n\n#### [Ryan Trinkle - Reflex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOy7zIk3IUI)\n\nFascinating talk!  In particular, I loved the way he explained why FRP is the best:\n\n1. equational reasoning, which I've been calling \"definitional\"\n2. local reasoning, or understanding apart from context, which I've been calling \"being able to rule out parts of the application you don't have to read\"\n\nAnother key point I got from the video is that if you want to use ghci with reflex-dom, you can, but then you need to use the ghc binders, which requires a desktop environment to see stuff with. Or something like that. Maybe it means I can use ghci to do more than I thought I could...\n\nIn the talk, he shows this tutorial on [building a reflex library through building a terminal library](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform/blob/develop/examples/host.hs). Looks fascinating!\n\nI also skimmed another video, which had [a great example and quote about declarativity](https://youtu.be/92eXGvHFbzs?t=40m33s). He shows dynamic list, whose dependencies are all explicitly listed inside of it. Only one place to (recursively) look. This epitomizes why reflux is the only library I am still excited about.\n\nI reached out to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.systems), the Haskell dev shop he runs, to see if they're still hiring. I could definitely see spending some time there, which I can't say about almost any other company.\n\n### FRP Visualizations\n\nBefore I found the FRP Debugging articles, I was saying something along the lines of: we need visuals that support casual understanding of large, complex software programs. FRP support this because the metaphors are very visual. Just look at [rxmarbles.com](http://rxmarbles.com/) and [the cyclejs devtools](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/devtool). If you wanted to visualize imperitive programs, the best you could do is [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/), which merely helps you \"play machine in your head.\"\n\nIt turns out, I'm not the only one to want to provide more live visualizations for FRP:\n\n#### [rxfiddle](https://rxfiddle.net)\nMy inital reaction to this tool was \"neat!\" But upon closer inspection, I'm not impressed:\n\n* the high-level graph in the middle of the screen is confusing. It'd be best if you could zoom in and out on the same structure for high and low level views.\n* clicking on data points is confusing\n* the fact that they show opaque green dots instead of raw data is dumb, especially when it's a number\n\nThey try to vertically align data points. This is a reasonable strategy but doesn't scale super well for complex flows (maybe better layout could solve this). One idea I had would be to use color to show the lineage/causality of events.\n\nOne point they make is that more work needs to be done for combinators that modify flows in a less merge-y way, such as filters, folds, etc. Another point is what to do with a high-frequency event. One idea is sparklines, but there are many ways to compress data.\n\nAdditionally, I find it useful to have both representations of streams: a lazy infinite list, and also a single value that changes over time.\n\nOne final note is that they only show acyclic graphs, which is insufficient for my purposes as discussed elsewhere.\n\n#### [rxviz](https://rxviz.com)\n\nThese are fun. I like them a lot more than rxfidle. They do a great job of showing higher-order streams. They don't, however, show how streams combine to make other streams. They just show one output stream or stream of streams.\n\nFor completeness, here are some other links on visualizing FRP programs:\n\n* [rxvision](https://jaredforsyth.com/rxvision/)\n* [Rx Diagrams](https://blog.angularindepth.com/learn-to-combine-rxjs-sequences-with-super-intuitive-interactive-diagrams-20fce8e6511)\n* [ReScala RP Debugging](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2884815)\n\n### FRP flavors\n\nThis is a problem I've struggled with for a year or so now. There are so many flavors of FRP out there, with different points on the design space, it's hard to keep them straight.\n\nAndre Stalz has some interesting things to say on this topic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3zr6i0/conversation_whats_the_core_differences_between/) and [here](https://staltz.com/unidirectional-user-interface-architectures.html).\n\nJonathan Edwards suggested I make a survey type doc for them. Neat idea. [FRPZoo](https://github.com/gelisam/frp-zoo) already exists but doesn't quite capture what I want. Also, I don't care so much to compare them all. I want to simply find the one model I want and go with it.\n\n#### [Turbine](https://github.com/funkia/turbine)\n\nSeems like the most Conal-based FRP in JavaScript.\n\nHowever, you add stream on-click handlers in UI elements, which isn't for me.\n\n#### CycleJS, Elm, Redux\n\nAll have the same singleton state + reducer architecture I don't like.\n\nHowever, it is possible to do CycleJS without the singleton state as I did in [this Flappy bird](https://codesandbox.io/s/xlrynkqoqp) about a year ago. The question is: 1) can it do cycles? and 2) how do we like the devtools?\n\n#### [Reflex](https://reflex-frp.org)\n\nI haven't done much more with this, despite watching the videos above, but it remains the only library I still like, despite the annoying type quantifiers and ghcjs nonesense.\n\n#### Purescript\n\nPaul Chiusano suggested I see if Purescript has anything I like in FRP land. Maybe it'd be easier than Reflex.\n\n### Next steps 6/2/18\n\nThere are a few social things to figure out:\n\n* fall conferences\n* the next FoC meetup in NYC\n* a possible meetup in Boston with Nicky Case and Glen\n\nA few other next steps:\n\n* update my Workflowy with notes from today's reading & watching\n\n* cyclejs with non-singleton state - can we do cycles? what do the devtools do (particularly as compared to singleton state)?\n\n* look for PureScript FRP library\n\n* continue learning Reflex. I found [this tutorial](https://github.com/hansroland/reflex-dom-inbits/blob/master/tutorial.md)\n\n#### What am I driving towards?\n\n1. An essay about comprehensible programming\n2. A comprehensible & casually editable ToDoMVC\n3. Tufte-inspired (show data, show comparisons, etc) visualizations (and editor) for cyclical, higher-order, GUI streams\n\n#### Anxiety about speed, focus\n\nI wish that it was more obvious what I should work on next or focus on for this week. I am feeling a bit anxious about getting to a polished published piece of work that I can point to and be proud of, similar to my Visual History of Eve in that it is polished and got attention, but more impressive and meaningful, like a Staltz or BV article.\n\nHowever, while today wasn't particularly directed, it was definitely quite productive. It took me ~2 hours just to write up all that I did today. I just have to trust in the messiness and hope that a smaller piece of a project will appear and provide itself for polish and publish at some point.\n\nAs far as tomorrow goes, let's start by re-reading this entry and going from there...", "changes": [[52, 0, "essays/app-idea.md"], [2, 4, "essays/power.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530114163, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530113857, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "35e3a11ee93bd8c044d0b7c8f3697cc77598bf32", "parents": ["9c5815a3a141bb3c9bed2bc679934230381a9a8e"], "commit": "97f5dba2de0a9ae255e3e5641ab261cd997408e5", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530113857, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530113857, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "9a0356cb167e480edf7d7540107ed7a1e6843539", "parents": ["b4928602510eeeb849bee376b75a37516af5c526"], "commit": "9c5815a3a141bb3c9bed2bc679934230381a9a8e", "message": "## Another vision-y essay\n\nI started another essay today.

I'm stil not sure how to combine or seperate those essays.\n\nEven worse, I've been collecting a large number of notes to add to these essays, and I don't know where they go...\n\n* include referneces to http://glench.com/LegibleMathematics/ in my visualizable essay and also talk about how visualizations are key. they're already in our heads even if we don't know it.visual metaphors. maybe quote the monad guy. quotes about mathmaticians who see things.\n* also I can clarify that when trying to improve understandability of programming you can either improve the model or the interface, and how I'm working on both dimensions at the same time (paul chiusano leverage, glench is only on UI where I used to be, etc)\n* comprehensibility: model + interface...steps proj, Nile + Bret’s visualizations\n* Haskell note from rattray: compiler knows more than you do\n* declariative langauges stink but they allow for foundation for visual tools such as squarespace and looker", "changes": [[62, 0, "essays/power.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530029786, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530029060, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "b356e7eca51d05790655f24e7dc7df9de2c048b5", "parents": ["de56bfddae1a4b57830e22e696ad3aedccd1f08a"], "commit": "b4928602510eeeb849bee376b75a37516af5c526", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1530029060, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1530029060, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "4adefed6544af9038943cc3bb969ed9ef4b851c5", "parents": ["c7cf2efe3e85253918e675cd9fc64637dd533ad8"], "commit": "de56bfddae1a4b57830e22e696ad3aedccd1f08a", "message": "## Started visual programming essay\n\n* TOC\n{: toc }\n\n### Prisma yesterday\n\nI spent yesterday researching GraphQL for Dark. I combined a few pictures on their website to explain Prisma. It's a little complicated, because it's solving  a GraphQL problem with more GraphQL, but I think this photo explains it pretty well:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One graphic to explain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prisma?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@prisma</a>, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GraphQL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GraphQL</a> ORM-like layer <a href=\"https://t.co/8jaq2ayUGK\">pic.twitter.com/8jaq2ayUGK</a></p>&mdash; Steven Krouse (@stevekrouse) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevekrouse/status/1011296632221110279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n### The Software Elephant\n\nI was inspired by a wonderful conversation this morning with [James Somers](http://jsomers.net/) (of [The Coming Software Apocalypse](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) and many others) to write up my thoughts on how visualizations will save programming. I somewhat-recently read [Fred Brook's No Silver Bullet](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf) where he very eloquently argues that software is \"inherently unvisualizable.\" What makes Brooks so great is that he gives you such a wonderful structure for your arguments, including great metaphors. I actually can't believe my metaphorical luck: in a relevant quote he refers to software as an \"elephant,\" which is perfect because it allows me to reference the story of the blind men and the elephant. I 'm pretty pumped about the rough draft / outline I've come up with in the last 2 hours.\n\nI'm not sure how this essay relates to [Casual Programming](./essays/casual). Maybe it's a replacement? Maybe they're somehow complimentary?\n\n### Next steps 06/26/18\n\nI'm pumped to get this essay polished and published before continuing trying to understand Reflex, etc, etc. I think it's useful to take a break to explain the *why* of what I'm doing before spending more time doing. This post might be similar to [my first (and favorite) Andre Staltz post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180530055638/https://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom), which is similar in that its a mile-marker on his way to creating CycleJS.", "changes": [[116, 0, "essays/visual.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1529856180, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1529854579, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "f37807c559c1aa693a265f3e1b01dee1786ca08a", "parents": ["00226f93964db7224b2ad180ed424df43801eb22"], "commit": "c7cf2efe3e85253918e675cd9fc64637dd533ad8", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1529854579, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1529854579, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "ff6b1a83c5ea7bcd90aaf330f2ae1b3ba09391bb", "parents": ["5150eb68c8b1fb4078e2dce0375778c33e65638f"], "commit": "00226f93964db7224b2ad180ed424df43801eb22", "message": "## DOM Recursion Problem Solved by Reflex\n\nAs I wrote in [The Model-View Recursion Problem in FRP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suHgeUvls6MZLHholN6r4KK0G5VaYArjKnALvmmJQhU/edit#):\n\n> In \"Experience Report: Functional Reactive Programming and the DOM\", authors describe a “recursion between FRP and the DOM” problem: “…the DOM tree in an FRP application can change in response to changes in FRP behaviors and events. However such new elements in the DOM tree may also produce new primitive event streams… which the FRP program needs to be able to react to. In other words, there is a cycle of dependencies…”\n\n> You start with two buttons. The first button doesn’t respond to clicks. But the second button, when clicked, adds two more buttons to the page, where again the first button doesn’t respond to clicks, but the second button can add more pairs of buttons on click.\n\n> ... I believe ... the solution is mutually recursive like the code in AFRP, and looks something like:\n\n> `clicksCount = count $ merge $ map (\\[b1, b2] -> b1.clicks) nestedButtons`\n\n> `nestedButtons = repeat clicksCount [button, button]`\n\n> `buttons = flatten nestedButtons`\n\nTurns out the Reflex library allows me to neatly solve this problem. The core of the code looks like:\n\n```haskell\nrec\n  countedClicks <- foldDyn (\\a b -> if evenButton a then b + 2 else b) 2 clicks\n\n  clicks <- listListView (ffor countedClicks (\\n -> [1..n])) (\\ _ x -> dynTextButton x)\n```\n\nAnd it only took me ~5 hours to write those two lines. No joke. I use a few helper functions of my own creation. You can see the [full code here](/code/reflex/button_and_text.hs). And the [live version here](/code/reflex/button_and_text.jsexe/index.html).\n\nAnd that ~5 hours is not including the ~3 hours it took to get reflex set up on my chromebook. Cloud9, AWS, Digital Ocean, and Codeanywhere all didn't work for different reasons. Eventually I got Google App Engine to work but I didn't realize the version I used would delete everything I install over night. So I created a more permanent instance on Google Compute which works as well and lets me SSH in using the browser. I just have to remember to turn it off when I'm not using it (which I am pretty sure stops the billing), otherwise it costs $100 per month because I'm using a big box.\n\nI'm getting better at emacs which is fun. I install haskell syntax highlighting and am using the shell from within emacs to compile the code in a different window. And I have `sudo python -m SimpleHTTPSever 80` so I can see the code after I compile it with `ghcjs`. I can't use a lot of the really cool emacs haskell extensions because I'm using `ghcjs` instead of `ghc` and `./try-reflex` instead of `cabal` or `stack`, but I'm doing OK now. It took me a while to get used to all the fucking types in reflex, but I'm getting the hang of it.\n\nNext steps... I'm a little lost in terms of what's next because this problem, along with [Reflex ToDoMVC minus a few features](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-todomvc/blob/develop/src/Reflex/TodoMVC.hs) seems to already be solved. One idea is that I can go through Reflex ToDo MVC, line by line, expression by expression, and type-annotate everything and add a bunch more comments. There are definitely parts of it I don't understand, such as the `def` keyword, `&`, and `.~`.\n\nIn a vague sense, I'm working towards building a \"CycleJS devtools dataflow diagram\" experience for Reflex, so another step would be to draw pictures for each type, or a way that I'd display it on the screen and show the values flowing through. And another good step that comes to mind would be to figure out how to get ahold of Reflex internals so I can get a sense of the network and hook into the different event firings.", "changes": [[52, 0, "code/reflex/button_and_text.hs"], [11, 0, "code/reflex/button_and_text.jsexe/index.html"], [6132, 0, "code/reflex/button_and_text.jsexe/lib.js"], [150666, 0, "code/reflex/button_and_text.jsexe/out.js"], [19964, 0, "code/reflex/button_and_text.jsexe/rts.js"], [2, 0, "code/reflex/button_and_text.jsexe/runmain.js"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1529608753, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1529605520, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "aa93817573b2952ea95593fc24bb3d21f44283ae", "parents": ["4b950551d915f52ffe1176e1c37e17e117622c6b"], "commit": "5150eb68c8b1fb4078e2dce0375778c33e65638f", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1529605520, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1529605520, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "39632516bcb267d4d2fa4e1808855bae4c166f21", "parents": ["b6192d48d70053db303925fb5d5d9dbd1d43d3bc"], "commit": "4b950551d915f52ffe1176e1c37e17e117622c6b", "message": "## What am I even working on again?\n\nJonathan Edwards very generously offered to give me some comments on what I'm currently working on if I would take the time to write it up. I spend most of Monday and Tuesday (like 10 hours) on it. My [first attempt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JQC7Zp3SqVO2zo5jaj5mADo-uV3qz66mUGuWyg299u4/edit?usp=sharing) spent a lot of time explaining the context for why I found this particular sub-problem (the DOM recursion problem) of the sub-field (FRP) interesting.\n\nBut I did away with all that in [the version I sent over](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suHgeUvls6MZLHholN6r4KK0G5VaYArjKnALvmmJQhU/edit?ts=5b2be6e1#), because that's what researchers do: they explain their problem in its context and attack it. They don't need to sittuate the problem in the broader context so much, because readers of technical papers often already know that context.\n\nThis exercise was challenging, fun, and very worthwhile, even before Jonathan gave me any comments. It's great to be getting some clarity on what I'm doing. I am proud of [the document I sent to Jonathan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suHgeUvls6MZLHholN6r4KK0G5VaYArjKnALvmmJQhU/edit?ts=5b2be6e1#).\n\nJonathan Edwards made some great comments. He suggested that I polish it up and submit to the [REBL track of SPLASH 2018](https://2018.splashcon.org/track/rebls-2018-papers). I have until Aug 17th to submit. The workshop is Nov 4th. Dominique Devriese, one of the authors of the Experience Report: FRP and the DOM, is on the organizing comittee. Maybe emailing him would be a good next step!\n\n### Casual Programming - first draft\n\nArmed with the newfound clarity around my research, I tried to explain my what I'm working on to two other programmers yesterday. It didn't go well. First of all, I wasn't able to get across the *why* of my research at all. I didn't *motivate the problem* well - neither of them agreed with me that a problem existed there in the first place. Secondly, I didn't do a good job of *defending the uninteresting parts of my solution*. My solution is to use a form of functional reactive programming, so I need to explain why FRP is the right tool for the job.\n\nSo I spent ~4 hours today on a draft of [Casual Programming][./essays/casual] (a phrase [Nikolas Martens used before me](http://blog.rtens.org/why-even-casual-programming-is-hard.html)) to contextualize the problem I'm working on within the vision of the world I'm working towards. It's a rough draft, needs a lot more fleshing out and examples.\nAlso I'm not entirely sure who the audience is, and what it's explaining to them. It's definitely not to be submitted to REBl, because they already get FRP and the problem. So I guess the audience is the programmers who are interested improving programming, but don't know all the academic stuff. The goal, I gues, would be to produce a blog post of similar caliber to Andre Stalz or David Nolan.\n\n### Todos 6/21/18\n\n* Continue working on [Casual Programming][./essays/casual]\n\n* Continue working on the academic version of Casual Programming, which I'm calling [The Model-View Recursion Problem in FRP\n](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suHgeUvls6MZLHholN6r4KK0G5VaYArjKnALvmmJQhU/edit?ts=5b2be6e1#). In particular, formalize things up, probably by using an existing FRP library, maybe arrowized, to test things in, maybe on the browser.\n\n* Email Dominique Devriese\n\nThat's it!

On the bright side, I have been quite productive, but in an analog sort of way...\n\n### Fedex Kinkos to Brother printer\n\nTwo weeks ago, I spent 3ish hours reading [Functional Reactive Animation](http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/) on my phone. I was finally able to make it all the way through, reading every word, and understanding ~80%. I was very proud. But, I didn't love reading on my phone - I wanted to print some papers out. I didn't have a printer at home -- I hate printers, they always break, and cost a bajillion dollars to buy ink for -- so I went to kinkos to print out most of Conal's papers:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/41498690-cb736744-7141-11e8-98b3-634d0b630f9e.png)\n\nBut here's where I felt like a stupid idiot: it cost $75 bucks to print all that! So I learned from my mistake and went on amazon to buy the printer with the cheapest cost per page, and found a [Brother printer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0763WDSYZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that fit the bill. It cost $70 itself, and will print ~500 pages before needing more ink. It's a 10x price reduction!\n\n### FRP Reading\n\n#### [Functional Reactive Animation](http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/)\n\nFinally able to make it through -- this was probably the 3rd or 4th time I attempted to read this paper.\n\n##### Bouncing Ball (solved)\n\nAs it turns out, Conal solved [my bouncing ball problem](http://futureofcoding.org/log#a-bouncing-ball-graph) in this paper. And I don't mean that he gave me hints towards the solution. I mean that he actually gave the code to solved the *same exact problem*. And it's beautiful:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/41498825-84ad7036-7144-11e8-95ec-ad2e0b9acc83.png)\n\nIt's very similar in spirit to what I created. Of course, there are no graphs or visualizations in the code, which is where I want to take this. FRP lends itself really well to live values and graphs.\n\n#### [Genuinely Functional User Interfaces](http://conal.net/papers/genuinely-functional-guis.pdf)\n\nAlso great. Also was able to read every word and understand closer to 90% this time.\n\n**Arrowized FRP is when you use signal combinators, not signals as first class.** This is supposed to help with spacetime leaks, as well as modularity. But of course, they are two-sides of the same coin, and it's easy enough to translate from one to the other.\n\n##### Paddle Ball is beautiful\n\nThe hardest parts of this definition are `xvel` and `yvel`, but it all makes sense when you read the paper and look at it for long enough:\n\n![screenshot 2018-06-16 at 9 09 38 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/41498840-0913ade0-7145-11e8-85f0-d14793df524a.png)\n\n#### [Denotational design with type class morphisms](http://conal.net/papers/type-class-morphisms/)\n\nHarder and slower. I probably got closer to 60% of this one, but I do feel like I have a much, much better grasp of what programmers mean whey they **model programming concepts with mathematical objects**, and what **semantics** means.\n\n#### [A Fifteen Puzzle in Fran ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-fifteen-puzzle-in-fran/)\n\nRead like a tutorial, explaining how to code an example project. Interesting and helped cement the ideas of FRP. Fascinating how he explained the structure of signal combinations in pictures:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/41498780-6b01893e-7143-11e8-9813-b7c5fa2be9f4.png)\n\n#### [Two-handed Image Navigation in Fran](http://conal.net/papers/TwoHanded/)\n\nAnother tutorial. A bit harder to follow.\n\n#### [Push-Pull FRP](http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/)\n\nI've been having trouble with this one, so have been putting this one off for now, but hope to get to it soon. It's a prerequisite for a number of other papers I want to read.\n\n#### [Asynchronous Functional Reactive Programming for GUIs](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/pubs/pldi13-elm.pdf)\n\nI skimmed through this one. I wasn't terribly impressed with Elm. I can see now how it's Haskell-lite and FRP-lite. It's definitely more synchronous in spirit, taking some interesting ideas without super-solid foundations and running with them.\n#### [Experience Report: Functional Reactive Programming and the DOM](https://2017.programming-conference.org/event/proweb-2017-papers-experience-report-functional-reactive-programming-and-the-dom)\n\nReally wonderful read - very easy for me to assimilate because I'm so familiar with the DOM. It also helped me see how much of the trouble of FRP comes from not properly and completely abstracting over the imperitivity of the DOM.\n\n##### Recursion between FRP and the DOM\n\nThey do a good job of specifying this problem:\n\n> ...the DOM tree in an FRP application can change in response to changes in FRP behaviors and events. However such new elements in the DOM tree may also produce new primitive event streams... which the FRP program needs to be able to react to. In other words, there is a cycle of dependencies...\"\n\nThe easy solution to this is to give elements names, which we can then use to filter the event stream, but that doesn't feel quite right.\n\nUltimately, the problem is referential transparency: I want to be able to create two buttons that look identical but when I put them next to each other, they emit two different event streams. How is this possible if they are identical? They are not identical! When they were put next to each other, the position of one of them was changed in the layout function, and thus they emit different event streams! Of course in order to preserve modularity (so we don't only get event streams at the top level, when everything is being laid out), we need to use a trick I learned from Conal where you translate the event stream going into a \"component\" with the inverse of the translation you used on its position. (I haven't entirely worked out this scheme, but I feel it's promising.)\n\n### Monad Reading\n\n#### [What we talk about when we talk about monads](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10195)\n\nFrom Jonathan Edwards. Great recommendation!\n\nBe careful about the \"romance of mathematics\". It's perfect-ness is illusory. Yet despite this, I still feel like math is our best way to reduce incidental complexity.\n\nThis definitely made me even more skeptical of monads! He showed cases where people put the word \"monad\" in the title of their papers when it had no business being there - just to show how cool they were.\n\n#### Monads and input/output (section 7 of [\"being lazy with class\"](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/history.pdf))\n\nFascinating to learn about. Moggi introduced monads to structure the denotational semantics of state and exceptions, but \"a denotation semantics can be viewed as an interpreter written in a functional language\" and \"Wadler used monads to *express* the same programming language features that Moggi used monads to *describe*.\n\n#### [Can functional programming be liberated from the von Neumann paradigm?](http://conal.net/blog/posts/can-functional-programming-be-liberated-from-the-von-neumann-paradigm)\n\nI printed this one out and re-read it for the 7th time. It's so fucking brilliant.\n\n\"Programming is more about the middle than the end, i.e., more about composition than output.\" And quoting Roly, \"What looks like imperative output can be just what you observe at the boundary between two subsystems.\"\nWe need imperativity in our functional code (usually structured with monads) when we haven't properly abstracted that particular API into a functional interface yet. For example, think about `putChar` and `getChar` from the terminal. How fucking imperative is that?! But FRP (even React) shows you that you don't need to put and get characters from the screen imperatively. Instead you can describe the UI input and output declaratively - no monads required! The way to get rid of monads is by abstracting over imperativity (databases, file systems, operating systems, etc), one by one.\n\n### Other Reading\n\n#### [Tangible Functional Programming](http://conal.net/papers/Eros/)\n\nI enjoyed the beginning, but also had trouble sticking with this one, but hope to get back to it soon. It's so up my alley!\n\n#### [Promise of Live Programming](https://2016.ecoop.org/event/live-2016-the-promise-of-live-programming)\n\nThis was a fun one. Live programming provides a rubric through which to rate a programming system, but not to come up with a programming system.\n\n#### [What's Functional Programming All About?](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html)\n\nThis is one of my favorites!

I had started it a few weeks ago, but I finished it on Friday.\n\nFirst of all, it's shocking to see how many key phrases in this field come from this book:\n\n* The Tar Pit (which is used by the famous \"out of the tar pit\" essay)\n\n* No Silver Bullet\n\n* The Mythical Man Month\n\n* Essential vs Accidental complexity\n\nMuch of the book is still relevant today, even though programming has changed a ton since the 60s, and of course many is just hilarious reminders of how much has changed.\n\n#### No Silver Bullet\n\nAs you may expect, the \"No Silver Bullet\" essay was the most relevant to me, and I LOVED it. Very, very thought provoking.\n\nThe premise of the essay is this: there will be no single magical solution that will drastically improve the beast that is programming. Instead there will be a myriad of small incremental improvements that will over time tame the beast.\n\nA wonderful analogy he uses to illustrate the premise: Before germ theory, we held out hope for magical solutions, such as the fountain of youth, to solve all of our problems. Germ theory, however, told us that no magical solution was coming. Instead we have a long term, tedious war, that will have to struggle against for decades and decades, making slow slow progress. Yet, once we accepted that and stopped wasting all our time looking or waiting for magic, we were able to get to work on making the necessary incremental progress, and look where we are now.\n\n##### Inherently Invisible (bullshit!)\n\nThus it's time to change our focus from the accidental complexity (of hardware limitations, etc) to the essential complexity of ameliorating the inherent difficulties of software development, which are its complexity (so much more intricate than other engineering disciplines), changeability (software is changed rapidly as compared with cars, for example), and invisibility (not naturally mapped onto a 2d visual plane).\n\nOk, I'll agree with him the programming is indeed harder than other kinds of engineering for greater complexity and change-ability. While fast changes are hard to deal with, version control in git and GitHub is pretty good, and I and others have a few ideas on how to improve this. Yet if it is indeed also inherently un-visualizable, than we are going to be hard pressed to address all the complexity in code.\n\nBut of course I strongly disagree that software is inherently un-visualizabe. I think if Brooks looked at the work of Bret Victor and Edward Tufte, he'd see that through innovative design work, we can increase the visualizablity of just about anything. While we might not have great visualizations today, have hope! Many visualizations that seem obvious now were not obvious before they were invented -- and it was in no small part data graphics that led the scientific journal revolution.\n\n##### We don't even know what's essential\n\nAdditionally, I deem much of what Brooks refers to as essential difficulties in programming as accidental to how programming is done today, and not at all essential to solving the problems at hand.\n\nThought experiment: how long would it take for you to describe Twitter, the entire application, from the consumer's perspective, down to every interaction and pixel? Maybe a couple dozen hours, maybe a hundred, at the outset. Yet thousands of engineers are working on it every day. Why? 99% incidental complexity.\n\nOf course, you may argue that to simply describe Twitter in English is not a fair test because English is not precise enough. So what language do we have that's 100% essential complexity, 0% incidental? My thought is that math is just such a language. It talks about conceptual objects and relations, not at all about how such things are computed (unless that's what you are talking about in math). And of course this is why I'm currently working on (as you can see in the last few entries below) describing UIs with only pure maths / piecewise functions with dynamic piece breaks.\n\n##### Communication and composibility are key\n\n100% agreed. So much of what stinks about programming today is that folder-and file interface of code. Impossible to navigate and communicate how things are built and run. I think a key way to overcome this is to build a sounder model for computation that lends itself better to communication and understanding (such as definitions only depend on explicit dependencies, and nowhere else).\n\nComposibility is also key, particularly for re-using code and collaboration.\n\n##### Object-oriented programming\n\nI haven't thought alot about OOP in a while. It's always felt lame to be, particularly because I learned it in Java and it was mostly about inheritance.\n\nYet there's one idea about it, encapsulation, which is kinda neat. The idea is restricting the mutation of state to a higher level operation, hiding the implementation details, and also limiting the number of pathways that can change state. Of course, in practice, objects often become dumb data structures and people just mutate their fields willy nilly with no encapsulation.\n\nI think what OOP is missing here is being explicit about who can access those pathways under which conditions. In other words, being clear about what can effect certain pieces of state, what it depends upon, as opposed to the protocol by which it can be ordered about by.\n\n### GoTo Considered Harfmul\n\nI can't believe it's taken be so long to read this. It's just 1.5 pages. It's so great. Makes me think that even more of what we do to program is also harmful in a similar way. As I've been saying recently, everything but mathmatical expressions are harmful. A new thing that I've been against recently is dynamic scope and lexical scope. Names are super dumb. Content hashing is really the only way to go.

This was glitchy some of the time too, making me thing there were bugs when it was that I was looking at older version of expressions.\n\n### Wolfram Bouncing Ball\n\nAnyways, it took me a 3-5 hours, but I finally got a piecewise, pure, mostly-non-recursive function which can be infinitely expanded of a bouncing ball. Let's look at the code:\n\n```\nsim[0] = <|start -> 0, end -> 0,  vel -> Function[t, 0], pos -> Function[t, 0] |>\nsim[n_] := sim[n] =\n  With[{start1 := sim[n - 1][end]},\n    With[{previousV := sim[n - 1][vel][start1]},\n      With[{vel1 := Function[t, -previousV*0.9 + -10*(t-start1)]},\n        With[{startPos := sim[n - 1][pos][start1]},\n          With[{pos1 := Function[t, startPos + ((vel1[t] + vel1[start1])/2)*(t -start1)]},\n            With[{end1 := First[t/.Solve[{pos1[t] == -473 && t > start1}], t]},\n              <|start ->  start1, end -> end1,  vel -> vel1, pos -> pos1  |>\n            ]\n          ]\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ]\n\npiece := Function[n, {sim[n][pos][t], t < sim[n][end]}]\n\nPlot[\n  {Piecewise[Map[piece, {1,2,3,4,5, 6, 7, 8}]]},\n  {t, 0, 100}\n]\n```\n\nWhich gives us the glorious result:\n\n![screenshot 2018-05-31 at 5 43 05 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/40809942-2d49c7fa-64fa-11e8-9662-c3fc1ac54195.png)\n\n#### Top-level explaination\n\nThis code isn't at all read-able, even by me, a few hours after I wrote it.\n\nFirst a top-level explaination: the code is creating a piecewise function. Every time the ball hits the bottom (-473), we need to create a new function to represent it's motion post-bounce.\n\nWhat's tricky is that each piece of the function depends on the previous piece's end values (when the ball bounces, we need it's old position and velocity). So we construct this recursive function `sim` which will generate us parts of bounces.\n\n#### Line-by-line explaination\n\n```\nsim[0] = <|start -> 0, end -> 0,  vel -> Function[t, 0], pos -> Function[t, 0] |>\n```\n\n`sim[0]` represents the initial conditions, lasting 0 seconds (as the start and end times are the same).\n\n```\nsim[n_] := sim[n] =\n```\n\nWe define `sim[n]` here and also let Wolfram know to (memorize the results of prior runs to `sim` so it doesn't need to recompute the results)[http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/FunctionsThatRememberValuesTheyHaveFound.html].\n\n```\n  With[{start1 := sim[n - 1][end]},\n```\n\nHere I begin a nested series of `With` statements. They are nested because the computations depend on each other and Wolfram `With` statements aren't smart enough to figure out how to handle that.\n\nSome of the variables defined in the `With` statements, such as `start1` above are eventually placed into the association (it's like a dictionary or object) below. I didn't name this variable `start` (as you would in another langauge), because Wolfram would then then I wanted the *key* to be the value of the start variable, such as `<| 4.34 -> 4.34, ... |>` -- so that's why there's a `1` after certain variable names.\n\nAnd now to the meat of this line: it says that the start of the current piece is the end of the prior piece. Pretty straight forward.\n\n```\n    With[{previousV := sim[n - 1][vel][start1]},\n```\n\nHere we calculate the final velocity of the previous piece, which we do by evaluating its velocity function on the starting time of this piece (which as we calculated above is the ending time of the previous piece).\n\n```\n      With[{vel1 := Function[t, -previousV*0.9 + -10*(t-start1)]},\n```\n\nHere we calulate the velocity of this piece:\n\n  * We reverse the end velocity of the previous piece, because the ball should bounce up with the same speed it hit the ground\n  * But not quite the same speed because balls never bounce as high as they did when they were dropped, so we multiply the speed by 0.9\n  * And then we changing the speed by -10, which is our acceleration, every second after the starting time of this piece.\n\n```\n        With[{startPos := sim[n - 1][pos][start1]},\n```\n\nThe starting position of this piece is the position of the previous piece at the end time of that piece (which is the starting time of this piece). This is the same way we found `previousV`.\n\n```\n          With[{pos1 := Function[t, startPos + ((vel1[t] + vel1[start1])/2)*(t -start1)]},\n\n```\n\nThen we calculate position:\n\n  * starting at the initial position\n  * then taking the average of velocity at the current moment and the velocity at the beginning of this piece\n  * and multiplying the average velocity by the time elapsed in the current piece so far\n\n```\n            With[{end1 := First[t/.Solve[{pos1[t] == -473 && t > start1}], t]},\n```\n\nAnd here we calcuate the time at which this piece hits the floor which I set here to be -473. The meat of this line `Solve[{pos1[t] == -473 && t > start1}], t]` simply asks to solve for `t` where the position is at the floor and the time is after the starting time of this piece. `First[t/.` is just extracting the computed solution out of the result.\n\n```\n              <|start ->  start1, end -> end1,  vel -> vel1, pos -> pos1  |>\n```\n\nAnd here we boringly compile the results of our hard work into a single data structure.\n\n```\npiece := Function[n, {sim[n][pos][t], t < sim[n][end]}]\n```\n\nThis function turns the nth simulation into an array suitable for the `Piecewise` function. It's first argument it the function to be plotted and the second argument is the domain over which it should be plotted. In this case, the first argument is simply the position and the second argument is that the time shall be less than the ending time of the piece.\n\n```\nPlot[\n  {Piecewise[Map[piece, {1,2,3,4,5, 6, 7, 8}]]},\n  {t, 0, 100}\n]\n```\n\nAnd here we plot 8 pieces of the simulation, resulting in the beautiful graph you saw above.\n\n### But why?\n\nI've been talking a lot about piecewise functions these last few days, to my mom and my girlfriend, and they both think the idea is kinda neat, but don't understand why I'm doing this. I don't have a great defense. Instead of spending 4ish hours making this graph, I could've done the [same thing in WoofJS in 9 lines of very readable code](http://woofjs.com/create#very-simple-ball) in *under 60 seconds* (I timed it):\n\n```javascript\nvar circle = new Circle({})\ncircle.v = 0\nforever(() => {\n  circle.v--\n  circle.y += circle.v\n  if (circle.y < minY) {\n    circle.v = circle.v *-0.9\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### I want definitions to be definitional goddammit!\n\nI want that when you define something it stays defined. I've had enough of these mutable reference cells that you can read to and write to at any time. I've had enough of playing Turing Machine!\n\nRedux isn't all that different than global state we had before. Sure it's easily serialize-able, which gives you undo and redo, and time travel debugging, but that's not all I want.\n\nI want to be able to look at a piece of code and know that the only things that can affect that code are written in it. A piece of code should depend on its dependencies. Nothing else should be able to change it. In this way you could understand a small section of your code without having to understand the whole thing. Without this we are doomed to read all our code if we want to understand what's going on.\n\nI don't know much maths beyond high school, so I wonder if my salvation lies in a more powerful structure than a piecewise function. If any math geeks out there are reading this, please let me know if you have any ideas!\n\n### Mitigating thoughts\n\nPossibly these explicit formula and the Logo/Woof implicit, recursive formula are just two sides of the same coin, and we could allow programmers to write in the more intuitive (change the position by X every Y) and then take the derivitive of that to get the explicit form. (It seems like there are ways to get explicit formula for any implicit or recursive formula, so this seems likely...)\n\nIn the same way, I wonder if we can convert a codebase where any mutable cell can be changed by anyone, and statically parse all the places in the code that *could possibly* have an effect on that value, and bring them all together so you can see you things are tangled. (I am doubtful of this because 1. which values are being modified can change dymaically so we can't really assess well statically, 2. I bet this would be such a gnarled mess that it's not really useful expect to show us all the folly of our entangled ways.)\n\n#### There are just a whole bunch of bad things I know about\n\n1 - Control flow of any kind seems like a terrible idea all around. You should just describe the system and the system shall determine which lines of code to run when. Non-monadic Haskell does a great job of doing away with this.\n\n2 - Mutable variables seem like a terrible idea, as discussed above.\n\n3 - The global state reducer from actions also feels like a terrible idea. I don't want anything to be able to emit an action that can change any part of the system. If you look at a piece of state, how are you to know which actions could affect it? I also feel like it's too much power, allowing the system to change itsellf based on the past value of itself.\n\nBut how are these piecewise functions any better, you ask? Great qusetion! As you noticed, when a new piece of the piecewise function is being created, it depends on the values of the last piece. It has the entire state of the app to do what it wills with. Yeah I didn't like this either, but I wasn't able to thing up a way out of it. We really need to know the final velocity / position of the prior piece to start the next bounce. But I'm not terribly beat up about it: maybe allowing pieces to view prior pieces on piece transitions isn't so bad...?\n\nAs far as the first cricism of Redux from above, that the dependencies of a piece of start aren't listed in the state, I haven't yet dealt with that because I haven't built \"prototype\" to also work with unpredictable input, such as mouse clicks. But the idea is to allow mouse clicks to trigger new pieces to be generate at the time of the mouse click. Only time protoyping will tell if this new framework has any merits at all.\n\nPart of me wonders if I need to build an interface for this prototype because exisiting ones (such as Wolfram and Woof) just don't cut it. And part of the whole point is that I'm just constructing transitions between pure mathmatic functions, so should it be super easy to visualize the state of all my functions as graphs?!\n\nAt the very least, I'm glad I was finally able to articulate above my dislike of the current frameworks: you can't tell what's going on at X by just looking at X and asking for its dependencies.", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1527738703, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1527736680, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "0626a6e6dd69d0c1b4ad6a5dcd16f1df44559a45", "parents": ["a396e9cbf0a8ac545a39dd44bdc8d43a40018663"], "commit": "177e678065958fe2f542b17e8b1dcf9717699163", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1527736680, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1527736680, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "0b9a1045b942721deb9b2800518c59a05684bea8", "parents": ["c7571b9def732f73e5b721c0fe3e98ee3df5197d"], "commit": "a396e9cbf0a8ac545a39dd44bdc8d43a40018663", "message": "## Added old /journal entries to /log\n\nThis closes #66, get /journal entries into /log.\n\n### Notes on ObservableHQ\n\nI did it in ObservableHQ [here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@stevekrouse/parse-and-join-journal-to-commits), which was really fun and fustrating, both!\n\n* It took me 5ish to do this task in JS in ObservableHQ, when it wouldn't have taken more than 1 hour to do by hand (as there were only 68 elements).\n* I both hate and also love ImmutableJS. It provides an API like lodash which is great. It's annoying because the values don't [yet](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/custom-representation-for-object-in-the-output-cell/412/3) display well and I needed to add lots of printLine statements below my code `someImmutableValue.toJS()` just to see what was happening. Also I'd sometimes forget about it and use the old syntax and things would silently break: very fustrating! Also a bit annoying when you're doing `a.something(b)` and you want to switch the arguments - lots of typing! Probably lost an hour on ImmutableJS alone, but it was definitely worth it for the API, speed, and not having to worry about mutability ever.\n* I found the way that code was hidden by default (unless you pinned it open) was counter to what I wanted most of the time. I think I'd probably prefer the reverse: to collapse code when I'm done with it.\n* I lost another hour trying to use [simple-markdown](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown) which was waaaay more than I needed, given that all I needed was to split the string on a simple regex. Another hour or so gone there.\n* Maybe a half an hour was lost screwing up with momentjs, which would fail silently on me. So annoying! Give me an error goddamn it!\n* But the most fustrating loss of time came from writing functions: you can't see intermediate values and the debugging support is lack-luster. So the main benefits of a reactive tool is lost the second you want to abstract over a list! I was constantly creating a function and testing in on various elements, and then changing the index one at a time to see how it worked: `someFunction(someLIst.get(5))`. What's the point of putting my code in cells a whole function is just one cell?! You loose all the benefits of the cells and intermediate results because functions are just a textbox! Not entirely sure how I'd fix this but I have an intuition that it should be possible within this paradigm.\n* I really wish I could've also hid the output of a computation, for example the text of the journal which was really long.\n* You can't search through the code with ctl-f because it's mostly hidden.\n* You can't see (without reading) which cells depend on which other ones.\n* You can't drag cells into other orders.\n* It's a bit annoying navigating object hierarcy trees - it'd be better if it defaulted to a table or something maybe.\n\nIt's interesting to note how few operations I used:\n\n* A TON of `map`, `filter`, `some`, `max`, `find` and other Immutable list and map operators\n* regex\n* date parsing and diffing (momentjs)\n* importing the file over HTTP\n* downloading the result JSON as a file\n\nFor regex, I used [regexr.com](https://regexr.com) to live show me the output right on the data I was using.\n\nFor date parsing and diffing, I was constantly screwing this up and had to instrument my own code by hand to figure out in which ways. It definitely feels like there should be a regexr-like environment for this too.\n\nDitto for the list operations: no reason that any of these shouldn't show you the results in a more immediate way, and where you can see the intermediate values too of course. As said above, not 100% sure how to do this but I feel like it's not too tough.\n\nAs for importing and exporting data, not difficult once you find the example somewhere. I think those sorts of primitives should be easy at hand.\n\nSpeaking of easy at hand, I spend a TON of time switching tabs (ObservableHQ doesn't work great in half-screen) to look at the Immutable, Moment, simple-markdown, and various other documentations. It was annoying. They really need autocomplete on variable properties -- but also with documentation, preferably with examples!\n\nAnd of course, I think everything would've been beeter with stronger types. I wasted so much time thinking that everything was OK when it wasn't and banging me head against the wall. I want to know when things fail!\n\nAnd if you can do it with no syntax errors, that's pretty amazing too!\n\n#### Project idea: functional, immutable, strongly-typed notebook?\n\nThis all makes me think that there's a neat prototype opportunity here. All my prior protyotype ideas in this space have been very visually-focused, almost like spreadsheets. Very much like Glen's [FlowSheets](https://tinyletter.com/Flowsheets/archive). But what if we don't need the interface to be a spreadsheet (because variables (as opposed to column and row reference) and nested data structres are nice), but just a vertical series of cells (and cells within cells within cells for nested levels of abstraction)? Syntax errors aren't so bad (considering I haven't yet met a projectional editor I prefer, maybe save Scratch), but let's definitely get some strong types, solid primitives (data structure, string, date, HTTP, importing), and inline documentation.", "changes": [[58, 0, "_data/commitToJournalMarkdown.json"], [3, 2, "log.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1527736120, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1527736116, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "e9c7c48746379d3ee09844a311eb0e1aa57976c0", "parents": ["abbd200ca38348ab680010875ec672d74d445620"], "commit": "c7571b9def732f73e5b721c0fe3e98ee3df5197d", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1527736116, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1527736116, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "4c37972053da3775a4aac608597f9542868f08e4", "parents": ["511937f9300c5db64d211531b5e6f355d36d88e3"], "commit": "abbd200ca38348ab680010875ec672d74d445620", "message": "removed colons from page titles to mollify jekyll a la https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/549", "changes": [[1, 1, "episodes/21.md"], [1, 1, "episodes/22.md"], [1, 1, "episodes/23.md"], [1, 1, "episodes/24.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1527624807, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1527624120, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "924ec56a07e291b94f7e61ed2dcbb4f0c6f318db", "parents": ["cc6de1f0f6bf5f984c67be40eabf67e405e4ea77"], "commit": "511937f9300c5db64d211531b5e6f355d36d88e3", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1527624120, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1527624120, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "d9acaa84ec0594991a5ce2221543ad140aef8cad", "parents": ["a4f277e2319a7d2200ff1e5a927afddc4ffb1c86"], "commit": "cc6de1f0f6bf5f984c67be40eabf67e405e4ea77", "message": "## Math and physics as code\n\nI've had this intuition for a while now: wouldn't it be neat if you could somehow \"copy-and-paste\" your physics equations from your textbook and drop them into your computer and that be the code?\n\nLet's describe a bouncing ball.\n\nWorks great to start:\n\n```javascript\nconst a = (t) => -9.8 /* meters per second sq */ * 10 /* px per meter */\nconst v0 = 0\nconst v1 = (t) => v0 + a(t)*t\nconst p0 = 0\nconst p1 = (t) => p0 + (((v1(t)+v0)/2)*t)\n```\n\nBut what about the bounce? There are two problems:\n\n1) We need to reverse the velocity (multiply it by -1)\n2) We need to know at what time the bounce occurs\n\nHow about a piece-wise defined function? For starters, let's just hardcode the bounce intervals at 3, and 9:\n\n```javascript\nconst t_bottom1 = 3 // p1(t) === 0, solve for t\nconst v2 = (t) => -v1(t_bottom1) + a(t)*(t - t_bottom1)\nconst p2 = (t) => p1(t_bottom1) + ((v2(t) + v2(t_bottom1))/2)*(t - t_bottom1)\n\nconst t_bottom2 = 9 // p2(t) === 0, solve for t\nconst v3 = (t) => -v2(t_bottom2) + a(t)*(t - t_bottom2)\nconst p3 = (t) => p2(t_bottom2) + ((v3(t) + v3(t_bottom2))/2)*(t - t_bottom2)\n\nconst p = (t) => {\n  if (t < t_bottom1) {\n    return p1(t)\n  } else if (t < t_bottom2) {\n    return p2(t)\n  } else {\n    return p3(t)\n  }\n}\n```\nOk, let's abstract this so the ball can bounce forever-ish:\n\n```javascript\nconst eq0 = {\n  t0: -1,\n  v: (t) => 0,\n  p: (t) => 0\n}\nvar equations = [eq0]\nconst intervals = [0].concat(range(3,1000, 6)) // [0, 3, 9, 15, ...]\nintervals.forEach((t0, i) => {\n  var eq = {}\n\n  eq_last = equations[i]\n  eq.v_last = eq_last.v(t0)\n  eq.p_last = eq_last.p(t0)\n\n  eq.t0 = t0\n  eq.a = (t) => -9.8 /* meters per second sq */ * 10 /* px per meter */\n  eq.v = (t) => -eq.v_last + eq.a(t)*(t - t0) // NEXT: can't decrease by 0.9 because then 6 second hardcoded intervals are fucked up\n  // THUS: how do make dynamic\n  // MAYBE use something like http://algebra.js.org/ to solve the equations\n  // WHICH would eventually lead to allowing mouse click generated invervals\n  eq.p = (t) => eq.p_last + (((eq.v(t)+eq.v(t0))/2)*(t - t0))\n\n  equations.push(eq)\n})\n\nfunction eqI(t) {\n  const eqNext = equations.find(eq => t < eq.t0)\n  if (!eqNext) { return equations.length-1 }\n  const eqNextIndex = equations.indexOf(eqNext)\n  return eqNextIndex - 1\n}\n\nconst p = (t) => {\n  const eq = equations[eqI(t)]\n  return eq.p(t)\n}\n```\n\nFull code to be found [here](http://woofjs.com/create.html#physics-and-math/6).\n\nAs said in the code, next steps are:\n\n1) make the intervals dynamic (so we can decrease the speed by 10% each bounce), maybe using something like http://algebra.js.org/ to solve the equations\n2) see if we can additionally generate intervals by non-predictable user-input, such as mouse clicks\n3) ...turn into flappy bird?\n\nSome notes:\n\n* It was really annoying to code this, because math can be annoying especially inside JS. I wonder how much better it could be in the right kind of environemnt that supports this kind of maths with rapid feedback. I worry that expressing things in this explicit, closed form, with partial equations will be too awkward for people and the gains of mathmatical purity, expresivity won't be worth it. Regardless, I want to follow down this rabbit hole and see where it goes.\n* To really show why it's neat to do things in this closed form, I should probably add a time travel debugger thing, that also shows the positions and velocities and accelerations at different points in time, and change when you tweak the params.

I got distracted by one of her references, InterState...\n\n### [InterState](http://interstate.from.so/)\n\nIn [an earlier entry](http://futureofcoding.org/log#thoughts-for-next-week), I wrote:\n\n> how do Facebook’s Origami, CycleJS devtools, and statecharts somehow fit together?\n\nThis protoype seems to answer that question! I was so excited that I [sent it over to the StateCharts community](https://spectrum.chat/statecharts?thread=535444a5-1743-4124-b767-ed7b490db7ec)!\n\n### Finished re-watching Tangible Functional Programming\n\nReally wonderful! I missed the beauty here in the first watching. Notes [here](/nodes/conal-elliot).\n\n### Some interesting links I found along the way:\n\n* [Concur - a new FRP library](https://github.com/ajnsit/concur) - Found by searching \"Elm Fudgets\" after reading about [Fudgets](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~hallgren/Thesis/main.html#tutorial) on Conal's reccomendation.\n* [Forms/3](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/Forms3/forms3.html) - I've heard of this before but checked it out after seeing it referenced by Conal, and it's cooler than I remember.\n* [Links Lang](http://links-lang.org/) - I found this after re-reading [\"What next?\"](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html) by Graydon Hoare. So cool! Unifies all layers of the stack into one language. Excited to check this out soon!\n\n### Open problems as of 5/21/18\n\nAs I was falling alseep last night, I thought about the core problems with existing languages:\n\n1. Redux, Elm, and CycleJS are a pain to code in. Small changes require big refactors. More importantly, emitting actions that can edit state in any way feels similar to the global mutable state we started with, that Andre Staltz argues against in [his arrow post.](https://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom)\n\n2. IO (and async) in an elegant way. Monads and streams kinda stink and feel imperitive the same way Redux does. ([Conal agrees.](http://conal.net/blog/posts/can-functional-programming-be-liberated-from-the-von-neumann-paradigm))\n\n3. In order to build a solution to these problems, it also needs to be somehow inter-operable with existing web frameworks. Relevant questions include whether its interpreted or compiled, etc, etc.\n\n4. Another open questions is what the backend should look like in order to handle authentication, permissioning, persistance, etc.\n\n5. Another open question: if you want to add phsyics to an object in your code, why not add the equations from your physics class to your program? In other words, how mathmatical and high-level can we get? What's the highest-levle we can get and still have something computable (with good performance) at the end? Additionally, can we make a declarative langauge that's readable and debuggable? (The Seymour Papert's distinction between LOGO's first-person `FORWARD 1, RIGHT 1`, and math's third-person `x^2 + y^2 = z^2`, and how they are really just two sides of the same coin via the derivitive feels relevant here.)\n\n6. Soundness of the type-system from a Scott, Strachey, and Elliot perspective also feels relevant here. I don't want leaky or infinitely-complex abstractions.\n\nI'm not even sure if these problems are truly problems, or just things I don't yet understand. Yet, it feels very relevant to continue down the Conal Elliot, FRP rabbithole. I hope that the more I understand Elliot's and (also Hudak's Arrowized) FRP, the more I'll be able to explain why I dislike Redux, Elm, and CycleJS.

Holy shit this article is amazing. So many gems! I want to read this article again and again. Would love to email him and get his advice on where to apply my efforts towards improving programming.\n\n### Graydon Hoare-inspired reading\n\n* From Graydon, I was sent to learn about algebraic effect handlers in [Eff](http://www.eff-lang.org/), which didn't really impress me to be honest. Their pitch of \"you know how much you like exception handlers? Let's have more of those\" doesn't resonate with me because I never liked exception handlers. Feels to procedural, contextual to me. I much prefer it encoded in the types, such as a Maybe or Failure type.\n* [Koka](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/koka/) makes a little more sense to me, labelling functions based on whether it can raise an exception, possibly not terminate, and be non-deterministic... but I only skimmed the beginning.\n* I was VERY EXCITED to see [Frink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frink_(programming_language) and [\"units of measure\" in F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/units-of-measure).

It was quite fustrating, but in a motivating way: there's so much about programming that needs fixing!\n\nTo give you a taste, I've worked 23 horus at Repl.it. The first 4.5 hours were spent setting up my dev environment, then another 2.25 hours debugging my dev environment,  and ~2 hours fixing linting or flow type errors. And I believe most of the productive hours I spent were wasted waiting for webpack to recompile all my code for every little change. Sometimes I'd have to wait 10-20 seconds to see even a small change. Very fustrating and very slow! And, of course, so much of my time was spent understanding complex code, React/Redux abstractions, and funneling scope and state, etc, etc. So much garbage!\n\nFor the 10ish hours I wanted to work there, I clearly was not being productive enough to justify them getting me up to speed on their stack. As of yesterday, we parted ways, so now I'm down to the 1 part-time gig with Dark (and another one in the works, but it's touch-and-go if it'll close). As explained above, this work fustrated me so I'm happy to have it off my plate, but I also got enough fustration to re-spark some motivation in a positive way.\n\n### Thursday 5/3/18\n\nI read from 10am to 3pm. It was interesting but also difficult to stay focused.\n\n* Lucid Synchrone - skimmed\n* Sean McDirmid's Live Programming Video - Awesome! I want to review more of his work.\n* Conal Elliot Haskellcast video - So great. Took notes [here](/notes/conal-elliot).\n* Typeclassopedia - read for a bit, then skimmed.\n* [History of Haskell](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=2B48E418C19376C73F08B593DCFDCAB7?doi=10.1.1.168.4008&rep=rep1&type=pdf) - read the first half, then skimmed.\n  * Haskell was created to solve the \"tower of babel\" problem around all *lazy* langauges sprouting up. Purity and typeclasses came later.\n  * I/O was intresting too: streams, contiuations, world-passing, and Monads\n* Can Programming Be Liberated...?\n  * No variables or substitution! Just one input functions and function combinators.\n\n### Friday 5/4/18\n\nI wasn't so motivated on Friday, so I mostly read Understanding Comics (reccomended by Conal and BV), and did some part-time work for Dark. I also had a group call with Dennis Heihoff, Shaun Williams, and Ivan Reese, which was fun.\n\n### Devtools, not programming languages\n\nI've realized that \"devtools\" is a better way to describe the field I'm in that \"programming langauges\". Pretty obvious in retrospect, but took me a while to realize this.\n\n### Some ToDos I scribbled down last week\n\n* Stratchey denotational design\n* Conal's Denotational design with typeclass morphisms\n* Conal's Fran\n* Simon Friis Vindum, including http://vindum.io/blog/lets-reinvent-frp/\n* [Verlet](https://twitter.com/stevekrouse/status/987339448064053249) and [ConstraintJS](https://twitter.com/coreload/status/989313738539909120)\n* Sean McDirmid (and [these](https://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/archive/ch-phd.pdf) [papers](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/papers/PDF/Conversational_Programming.pdf) he referenced)\n* Reach out to Jonathan Edwards\n\n### Less passion\n\nI haven't been super productive or passionate about stuff in a little while. It's been a bit of a slog getting myself to do research.\n\nPart of the reason is that I've becommed obsessed with The Wheel of Time series on audibook and am making my way through. Almost to the end!\n\n### Foundations\n\nI find myself increasingly curious about foundations, mathmatics, precision, abstraction, etc. I've always been on the fringes of the strong types community, and proving program correctness. These things were what the professors were up to a Penn while I was there. But I've never seen the need to dive in before. I think it was Conal's comments in the Haskellcast video that got me:\n\n1) Those that don't understand FRP are doomed to re-create inferior versions of it\n2) All the FRP implementations out there are more complex than their creators realize because they broke abstractions\n3) You don't truly understand how good or complex a design is until you describe it mathmatically, precisely\n\nMusic to Paul Chiusano's ears, I'm sure.\n\n### Vision: semantic and cannonical\n\nWhy am I so insistent that programming can be better? It's hard to put into words. As I was falling asleep a few nights ago, I was struck by how a two words kept coming to mind: \"semantic\" and \"canonical\". But what does that even mean? I have a fuzzy image of mathmatical expressions in the sky, with a white background behind them, and you can select different parts of the expression and get interesting information about the node, because it's a living object that can be manipulated...", "changes": [["-", "-", "media/declarative-models.png"], [31, 0, "notes/conal-elliot.md"], [33, 0, "notes/simon-friis-vindum.md"]]},

"## Morning FRP readings, and next steps\n\n* TOC\n{: toc }\n\n### Morning FRP readings\n\n#### Flapjax\n\nI started the morning by reading [the paper on the Flapjax language/library](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mgbcgbk-flapjax/paper.pdf). It seems to do FRP in much the same way that CycleJS does: stream combinators. It's kinda neat in how it makes things higher level, but just as with CycleJS, I found it quite difficult to parse the code. However, it is crazy to think that this pre-dated CycleJS by a decade... I guess this goes to Bret's point about aiming higher than \"improving programming.\"\n\n#### \"Real FRP\"\n\nI've gotten tired of [Haskell people talking about \"real FRP\"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7965027), so I spent a few hours re-reading [the Fran tutorial](http://conal.net/fran/tutorial.htm) and re-watching two of Conal's talks on it ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Q32brCUAI) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teRC_Lf61Gw)). Finally, I feel like I have a clear understanding of what people mean by \"real FRP.\" I don't think I had seen enough of the \"fake FRP\" when I first watched the video to understand the distinction:\n\nReal FRP is (mostly) about continuous time, in the same way that vector graphics are about continous space. In other words, \"resolution independent time\", or \"time as a function from the real numbers\".\n\nReal FRP is also about denotational design, of which I feel slightly closer to groking, but likely still a hundred hours of Haskell away from. One day I'll memorize the Typeclassopedia and everything will make sense.\n\n### Next steps\n\n#### Hareactive\n\nThis is a JS library for \"real FRP\", and I'm excited to play with it a bit.\n\n#### Sean McDirmid\n\nI've been seeing his name pop up a lot recently, so I'm excitd to check out this [Live Programming Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLrdhFEAiqo) video. Maybe I'll reach out too...\n\n#### Callbags\n\nI'm excited to check out Staltz [new article on Callbacks](https://egghead.io/articles/comparing-callbags-to-rxjs-for-reactive-programming).\n\n#### Facebook Origami Community\n\nAnother thing I want to do is continue to investigate how far I can push Facebook's Origami.

This article on [Lucid Synchrone](http://www.di.ens.fr/~pouzet/bib/chap_lucid_synchrone_english_iste08.pdf) looks good.\n\n#### Prototype a better text-based dataflow langague\n\nAs in re-write the logic for [a game I made yesterday for fun in WoofJS](woofjs.com/create#ballz). Maybe I could re-write it in Hareactive or just prototype it on paper (without a library to back it up).\n\n#### More centralized place for todos\n\nIt's a bit crazy to put them in a log like this...

I'm going to follow up with a few ideas for improving their IDE interface, and then possible begin developing for them part-time. I'm very excited about this!

I read parts and skimmed parts of both. They seemed semi-relevant to what I'm trying to do. As far as I could see, neither referenced the management of complex, nested state. They seemed to assume that non-state data (such as the currently displayed value on the calculator screen) was stored somewhere magically.\n\nI then read a series of Andre Staltz posts. It turns out my link to his post on Friday was actually the incorrect post. I meant [this one](https://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom). He had a lot of other interesting posts, but I found myself not excited about the conclusions he drew. In particular, I didn't like his discussion of [hot vs cold observables](https://staltz.com/cold-and-hot-callbacks.html) because I don't love his conclusions, although I couldn't find any fault with his logic. It'd be a bummer if there wasn't a more elegant way to model this distinction. It really seems like an incidental complexity type of thing. I also came to realize that I find stream-based programming a bit annoying. While it's kinda cool, I wonder if it's overly abstract, the way Haskell can get sometimes.\n\nI then re-read (for the 10th time), [Elm's Farewell to FRP](http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp). Again, an article that feels profound but that I don't like for some reason, mostly because there are a lot of concepts in it that I don't quite understand, but don't like the conclusions reached. It feels similar to when I had to learn AngularJS. I don't really know what the concepts mean, but I can tell somehow that they are less elegant than they could be.\n\nFrom there I found my way to [Lucid Synchrone](http://www.di.ens.fr/~pouzet/bib/chap_lucid_synchrone_english_iste08.pdf), but stopped after a few paragrahs, and just like with statecharts decided I wanted to go to the source, so I started reading [Lucid](http://worrydream.com/refs/Wadge%20-%20Lucid,%20the%20Dataflow%20Programming%20Language.pdf). I'm actually a little shocked that I haven't read this before. There's so much here that I was slowly coming to on my own, but it feels like they've brought it all together for me. And, of course, Bret Victor is a big fan of it I've heard, although I wasn't able to find his thoughts on it anywhere on the internet. My next steps are definitely to read through this, and maybe the Synchrone Experiment.\n\nAnd as much as I want to avoid it, it seems like I may have to get my hands dirty with all this theoretical stuff.

I think the main feature that got me is that you can see the live-updating intermediate values of all computations. It's amazing. It makes looking at static code unbearable. Additionally: there's no run button - it's hot-realoading. And they have a great way to add nodes (they call them \"patches\") via the keyboard.\n\n### Node-and-wire prototyping\n\nThis morning, I had the idea of prototyping the Origami UI in Woof. I had a fun few hours doing it: http://woofjs.com/create#origami\n\nI had to come up with techniques for managing lots of things I'd never had to do before in Woof, mostly around nested components and layout. Stuff that HTML and CSS does for you in annoying ways. Turns out it's pretty annoying to calculate widths and paddings manually too...\n\n### Thoughts on a new language...\n\nThe idea in my head is that you have a dependency graph of all the values. The trick, of course, is sequential evaluation and events. Mostly events.\n\n#### Pure expressions\n\nThese are simple. They should always have live-updated values.\n\nThey are normally things you'd want nested internally (which is a common complaint of node-and-wire tools), but when \"proccessing\" a thing, you want vertical or horizontal sequencing, such [as in Elm](http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax#infix-operators).\n\n#### Sequential evaluation\n\nI think we can do away with it entirely. If you actually need it, you can model it explicitly as [I show in this demo](http://woofjs.com/create.html#animate-via-frames).\n\n#### Events\n\nCan we do without and just have reactive values? Clicks are reactive list of all clicks, and you can get last one and check timestamp a la http://futureofcoding.org/prototypes/streamsheets/.\n\nPotentially, this will be too conceptually difficult, for the same reaons it was to do [CycleJS Flappy Bird without centralized state](https://gist.github.com/stevekrouse/85f350eb82ebbf5b2c244aa9aeffc453) and we'll need a reducer. But maybe nested state via statecharts could save the day.\n\n### Follow up questions\n\n1 - What do I not like about cyclejs and elm (and what's the difference again)?\n\n1a - Is the main reason that it's terrible to code in streams and elm, and thus streamsheets?\n\n1a1 - Idea to make cycle better: swap it: make value be values and have a history function that gets the stream on it?\n\n2 - Is the main difference explicit modeling of time and explictly listing all state?\n\n2a - We don't really need explicitly listing state, just reactively defined\n\n2a1 - What is reactively defined state? wont it eventually bleed into everything depends on everything else and we're back where we started? in other words, the reducer thingy seems stinky for some reason ... it's annoying to use, but making it easier to use just gets rid of the benefits of using it\n\n2a2 - Can we make a calculus for how we want this to work to simplify things? Such as what I was trying to do with [Reactive Woof](http://futureofcoding.org/journal#reactive-woofjs) ... Or is this a cyclejs data structure?\n\n3 - How to statecharts keep track of state...? .. go to Ian's book\n\n3a - Can you do statecharts without events?\n\n4 - Difference between hot and cold streams?\n\n5 - At the end of the day, can we really realize my perception of Anre's vision in [this article](https://staltz.com/unidirectional-user-interface-architectures.html) that all things contain all the ways to modify that thing? Or is it impossible because we want to branch in too many ways in our code, not sequentially, but just with nested cases? Would it at all be possible to define things in one place only? Or would that just hurt our brains even if we could do it?", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1523027723, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1523026633, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "5e22a27d5ef184ad070ecb3e035494156fbee987", "parents": ["eb84c1c4442f7d69161fe99732b7976be804d650"], "commit": "632e8e84dfa09e159acb91a17d96e9644f8a5a50", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1523026633, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1523026633, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "2819df97a8fa82b8473fce4eb07c561eb77f52c3", "parents": ["fb0cf0ae55e30edbbbcc2c215e0ef56373f0fc2b"], "commit": "eb84c1c4442f7d69161fe99732b7976be804d650", "message": "## Thoughts\n\n### Eve Success\n\nI was a little surprised to see my Eve project stay on the front page for basically a whole day!

Echoing what I just heard from David Nolan, he mentions that we almost always choose bad abstractions and that they often get too much in the way. This point really stuck with me, because abstractions and math seem so elegant, yet maybe their overapplication, like with class inheritance in Java, is what gets us into trouble. On the other hand, simple primitives are portable and easy to understand.\n\nThen I read almost all of the articles on The world of statecharts, read most of the threads in the chat.\n\nRosmaro (and medium posts)\n\nhttps://sverweij.gitlab.io/state-machine-cat/\n\nI also read the first few chapters of [Ian Horrock's Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts](./media/Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts Ian Horrocks.pdf).\n\nI also took [some silly notes on how I'm beginning to view much of the \"evil\" in programming due to historical accidents that have remained with us long past their usefulness](./notes/historical-accidents). (Side note: I think it's probably fruitless to look for \"the root of all evil\" in programming, be it historical accidents today or primitives yesterday. There are two ways to replace this persuit: 1. Be more explicit about trade-offs, and the contexts under which you'd choose between alternatives, and 2. Look for a positive philosophy of what programming is, almost in the John Dewey sense.)\n\n### What remains\n\n* Finish reading [Ian Horrock's Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts](./media/Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts Ian Horrocks.pdf) after page 49.\n* Read [xstate's docs](http://davidkpiano.github.io/xstate/docs/#/) and maybe bulid something in it\n* Read the final two pieces of The World of Statecharts that I haven't read yet: [one](https://statecharts.github.io/use-case-statecharts-in-user-interfaces.html) and two](https://statecharts.github.io/how-to-use-statecharts.html)\n*\n(read more about rosmaro guy's no if and no boolean, as well as the anti-if campaign)\n* maybe post to [the statecharts chat](https://spectrum.chat/statecharts/general)\n* read [this research paper about statechart UI building](http://phrogz.net/developing-user-interfaces-using-scxml-statecharts)\n\n### Yearning for real-world problems\n\nAfter watching all of these videos, I was left with a sense of blah. What do I do with all of these thoughts? Is this method or that method better? Under which circumstances? My thinking became so divorced from any concrete problems that I felt impossible to compare the trade-offs between alternatives.\n\nAnd so I had an idea: what if I use coding on WoofJS as a way to explore many of these ideas. More specifically, what if I use refactoring WoofJS to explore some of these ideas?\n\nThe tantilizing idea would be to start small, maybe just one boolean flag, or one function, and slowly refactor the app back to some sort of sanity. Of course, we still are left with the problem of determining what is sane and what is insane. I don't want to simply move WoofJS from VueJS to some new platform, like CycleJS or Elm or xstate, and just have similar-ish problems but in a new framework. That's a very expensive way to try out a framework.\n\nYet on the other hand, I fear that re-building simple apps, like a button that counts how many times it's been clicked, or even ToDo MVC will not expose me to the truly intricate and sticky problems that would expose whether an approach is good, and also motivate alternative approaches to solving such real-world problems.\n\nA relevant thought here is to bring in Alan Kay's advice to Samantha John: make a list of a few complex applications you want to be able to create in a framework to test and motivate its generality. This is reasonable advice. Some that come to mind:\n\n* [ToDo MVC](http://todomvc.com/)\n* [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)\n* Basic scratch games (http://coding.space/scratch)\n* Basic JS apps (http://coding.space/web)\n* Agar.io\n* Candy Crush (Sam John's idea)", "changes": [[34, 0, "notes/historical-accidents.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1521741643, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1521741643, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "d6e96e0eac49b2c7aaf80bdc3cbe601e0fd352c0", "parents": ["28c9e628b5e007b34955a246e9536cc580e17789", "46bf255e44394ddc374c95ee4ad148a98d877b6e"], "commit": "d7927bb75c830df0f81bb8a2773c01dddb7ecf7a", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1521661896, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1521661664, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "70bad05062c4612b964050b365542e77f34277f7", "parents": ["f1b011d8db43b25f17aafc8cc129f9bbcbef08f5"], "commit": "28c9e628b5e007b34955a246e9536cc580e17789", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1521661664, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1521661664, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "1be797eb1beec2a6708c84c80d11debb3dffc6bc", "parents": ["e2dc2ff7555091061e6d521fa1b5a588453dec57"], "commit": "f1b011d8db43b25f17aafc8cc129f9bbcbef08f5", "message": "## Fun, fustrating, little progress on killing primitives\n\nPart of the problem doing work on the computer is that I'm too plugged in.

I think there are a few reasons I lost direction here:\n\n1. I saw a lot of really smart people that I look up to have a hard time in this space (Bret, Alan, Chris Granger)\n2. I felt that my chances of success were dim\n3. I found it difficult to explain what I was doing to friends, family and strangers at parties\n4. I lost track of who or for what use-case I was doing this work\n\nSo I started looking for full time work as an engineer. Got a job offer. Turned it down. Then found some part-time work...\n\n### Dark (Paul and Ellen's new startup)\n\nPaul Biggar (of CircleCi) has started a new company with Ellen Chisa. They reached out to hire me to do some consulting work for them part time, like 5-10 hours per week. It's actually been amazing, potentially exactly what I needed to get re-invigorated here. I started working with them in early Feb, doing analysis of developer companies, like Eve or Luna. Would love to get some of this work on here in a productive way.\n\nIt's actually been really heartening doing this analysis. I am beginning to see how companies like Eve made mistakes that I could avoid, such as spending years iterating on visual programming interfaces or overly optimizing for beginners right off the bat.\n\n### Fuck the learning curve\n\nIn other words, I am finally beginning to come around to Paul Chuisano's view that learning a new system is a one-time cost. Of course we want to onboard users as fast as possible but it's not the most important thing to get right on day 1, and it's definitely not the thing to optimize for. Instead, let's fuck the learning curve and optimze for the producitivity in the medium-term. (We can always build a better interface later, maybe even a syntax-less one, but text is great for iterating quickly.)\n\n### Working on Woof\n\nHowever, probably the thing that has got me most excited about returning to this project is [the work I did on Woof last week](https://github.com/stevekrouse/WoofJS/commit/04a7ce1e3e371957d4304a049e96dc8a6818bc59). It took me ~6 hours and was mostly super fustrating, but also fun and addicting, like a video game. It reminded me how much I both love and hate programming, and hinted at how amazing it could be with the right abstractions.\n\n### Overloading\n\nA few weeks back, r0ml was kind enough to give me a guided tour of both APL and Squeak Smalltalk. Both were incredibly fascinating and inspiring!\n\nWhile the APL overloading and concise mentality is admirable in some respects, I also wonder if it could be the root cause of much evil. The thought goes something like this: if you use the same concepts for multiple different contexts, you end up artifically boxing yourself in unneccesarily. Instead if you could be more specific about the \"shape\" of your app, and all possible *semantic* states it could get it, you could more purely represent your app as a system of relationships, and then understanding and extending it would be greatly simplified.\n\nThis builds upon my ideas of the past such as \"booleans are too generic,\" to include such ideas as \"integers are too generic.\"\n\n![overloading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/37614064-9828a254-2ba1-11e8-899f-59385ade596d.jpg)\n\n\n### Thoughts about where to spend time\n\nI think I need a new framework for this work. I made a list of the type of activities that I do here:\n\n![time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/37614063-980234f2-2ba1-11e8-9470-196128b4c73c.jpg)\n\nI wonder if it would be better if I structured my work around publishing stuff and trying to get views or upvotes on HN. I like it because of the social proof and it would feel good, but I am worried it's too much click-bait-y and focusing too much getting attention.\n\nAnother thought is to focus my attention on a really small problem that I think I can solve well.\n\nAnother thought is to find a mentor or some structure in the context of other people.\n\nAnother thought that gives me solace is that this stuff is really deep and complicated and the key is optimzing for long term productivity and excitement, so I need to find a structure that lets me have fun here for a while, while staying productive...\n\n#### Throw out HTML, CSS\n\nAnd a final thought is to pick a big ambitious project to spend most of my time on. One idea that I keep returning to is \"throwing out the DOM (HTML, CSS) and starting over on the canvas,\" including building input boxes, etc, from scratch. This project is quite similar to Morphic (more specifically, morphicJS) so I'd start with research there, and try to find other attempts at this vision. Potentially, the canvas is not the right compile target and something more modern or cross-platform would be better, like openGL.\n\nI really admire Elm (and Fran, but need more research here). Also Brent's Diagrams is interesting for inspiration. The dream would be a very mathmatical language, one in which centering stuff, laying it out, would be super simple. Ditto for animation. All maths and relationsihps. All very pure. And cross platform is by default because so abstract. And reactive by default because canvas is immediate mode already. Also, it will be \"turtles all the way down,\" like Smalltalk, in that there's no browser magic elements, like <input>. Everything is hackable. Don't just change the CSS: change the actual thing or whatever.", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1521481529, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1521481492, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "e69769e1cc5c45f4bcc22c2af7cbed21a4eff279", "parents": ["6ac6e76a438ce1144fc9f5ea226d3754924594b9"], "commit": "653b9472e17d96488536ccb9f2f5a15c6192b00f", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1521481492, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1521481492, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "ec98f3b2a6b7467663d1fec779aa2813ed39b618", "parents": ["b16a867d92cfc181ce499a7d4b196533a7c02a28"], "commit": "6ac6e76a438ce1144fc9f5ea226d3754924594b9", "message": "## Started Eve Tribute\n\n(I acutally did this work a few weeks ago and forgot to commit.)", "changes": [[231, 0, "essays/eve.html"], [167, 0, "essays/eve/index.html"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/FiveSquare.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/aurora.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/card-wiki.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/excel-eve.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/first-syntax.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/first-ui-editor.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/grid-eve.gif"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/madlibs-notebook.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/markdown-eve.gif"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/table-eve.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/when-do-madlibs.png"], ["-", "-", "essays/eve/media/wiki-eve.png"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1517519283, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1517519280, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "2bd5b918e1f73813febe925ff02c43a32bc424de", "parents": ["b1dd71ab1bfe1c4bb8183bb3940168739747f9d6"], "commit": "b16a867d92cfc181ce499a7d4b196533a7c02a28", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1517519280, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1517519280, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "74534acbd9f7f31b6a506ccd6e4724fe93be2fd0", "parents": ["485ac4380dee5a7d4a87d01f4d00dbd1b2f515cb"], "commit": "b1dd71ab1bfe1c4bb8183bb3940168739747f9d6", "message": "added ep 21, aidan cunniffe", "changes": [[27, 0, "episodes/21.md"], [1, 0, "index.html"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1516728432, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1516728430, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "1aebc98dece912eb19408637ad397769be279258", "parents": ["6bcf90218784bd68434a773f92d6c875719e7d4c"], "commit": "485ac4380dee5a7d4a87d01f4d00dbd1b2f515cb", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1516728430, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1516728430, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "d846ffb217c57bbe3f5502645c9d17749ae7e874", "parents": ["10a6980535c837d4f1d222d657beeb351c1ede6d"], "commit": "6bcf90218784bd68434a773f92d6c875719e7d4c", "message": "add dynamicland recap", "changes": [[44, 0, "notes/bret-victor/dynamicland.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1516662048, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1516661642, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "23670b2d017b48339920a8c0fc44f87d0fb34334", "parents": ["56f6c4f89322fb88e8ec8f4d4be2069ab3688b2b"], "commit": "10a6980535c837d4f1d222d657beeb351c1ede6d", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1516661642, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1516661642, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "0ee913610ed904317ec0c3541541cd78b74137b4", "parents": ["696fbd0a916cc2c4ad083431e08693b7d1012977"], "commit": "56f6c4f89322fb88e8ec8f4d4be2069ab3688b2b", "message": "## Journal break\n\nGiven how Bret Victor is the main inspiration for this project, it was really really fascinating to spend so much time around him last week.

"## Rushed BV deep dive\n\n### Quick progress\n\nQuick & dirty progress with little to no note taking was made today on a number of BV things:\n\n* Media for Thinking the Unthinkable\n* The Future of Programming\n* Seeing Spaces\n* RESEARCH AGENDA AND FORMER FLOOR PLAN\n* The Humane Representation of Thought\n\nAs well as a few selected references that he linked to from those (or the notes for those), but you'll have to see my notes in this commit for all that jazz.\n\n### Remaining things\n\nThought I didn't get to them today, I think it would be useful to me to read both Bret's _2013 links_ and _What a technologist can do about climate change_ before I show up at Dynamicland. I have plenty of time for both of these things before Monday at 1pm PST, but it's also not a tragedy if I don't get to them.\n\nAs far as my BV deep dive goes, I'd say that it's as done, if not more done, than the deep dive I did into Alan Kay. There's more to be looked at for both men, for Alan there are many videos, and for Bret, there are past websites, projects, and journal entries. But I suspect that after next week, I will feel content in my knowledge of Bret Victor for now, and would be more happy spending time with his sources, than with him directly. And of course, re-reading and re-watching is always useful so I can always comes back to this if I need to.\n\n### Self-directed masters program\n\nOn a trip to the bathroom, I picked up Richard Rorty's _Philosophy and Social Hope_ and was blown away by the first few pages. He alluded to being able to dissolve [my current paradoxical thoughts on the distinction between inventtion vs discovery](/essays/invented-or-discovered). It feels like Rorty might do for Dewey what Deutch does for Popper.\n\nAnyways, I have a stack of books in front of me ranging from Piaget to McLuhan to Raskin to Vygotsky to Brooks to Rheingold to Minsky to Hofstader. And I have at least another dozen such books elsewhere that feel like essential reading for me to live a fufilled life. Thus had the thought to structure all of this reading and reflecting into an organized structure of some sort, which I am currently referring to as a \"self-directed masters program.\" Here are some of the tasks (unordered) that represent my current thinking of the next steps here if I choose to continue planning in this direction...\n\n* look into how other masters' programs, PhD programs, or other programs of study are organized, such as [Open Masters](https://www.openmasters.org/) and [Steph Jang's post](http://stephjang.com/blog/free-masters-program/)\n\n* think about the topics / questions / goals (in other words, why do this over getting a job or starting a company, or any other possible thing?)\n\n* will there be a thesis or end product, one or many?\n\n* mentorship?\n\n* physical location?\n\n* time\n\n* budgeting", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"], [130, 4, "notes/bret-victor/index.md"], [2, 0, "notes/bret-victor/questions.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1515780096, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1515779539, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "87c34418b4758330b4de0bd9c2e22ae864e0d593", "parents": ["4a45b8253d0ea3efca8c63b00621014256296fc5"], "commit": "4c0956275a911a474347b052709529f5955f098f", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1515779539, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1515779539, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "79983bdafbcbecbe4ea0dfb0c40d2b50188a4d2d", "parents": ["d5bc039ec025da465c41863f9350860281dbe280"], "commit": "4a45b8253d0ea3efca8c63b00621014256296fc5", "message": "## Plan for 01/12/18\n\n### _Media for Thinking the Unthinkable_\n\nI spent the morning watching _Media for Thinking the Unthinkable_, again without taking notes, but still making an effort to read sources, which in this case included [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2321982) and [An Ill-Advised Personal Note about \"Media for Thinking the Unthinkable\"](http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html), the ladder of which had a few wonderful gems, including:\n\n> Any concept, technique, or tool that is specific to software engineering is guaranteed to have a short shelf life, at least on any time scale that I personally care about.

When I turned the page and found the beginning of the next chapter, I would intend to take a break, but figured I might as well read first read the first few lines of the next chapter just out of curiosity. But then my curiosity would be so piqued that I'd find myself going chapters at a time without breaks. It was a good 4 hours of Tufte today.\n\nGiven that I don't have any immediate concrete, practical use for these skills, I'm not sure how useful it felt. As a study in where ideas come from, it was interesting to see many Bret Victor ideas I'm familiar with in their original context. For example, I recognized sparklines, a Tufte invention, from BV's work (although in a quick web search, I am unable to find an example of this...) This speaks to the question of pre-loading vs just-in-time learning. I feel like most of the value in my reading today will be in knowing where the answers to questions about data visualization will likely be found -- and that there are answers here at all -- rather than the actual rules or techniques that I read given that I am likely soon to forget them in the absence of applying them anytime soon.\n\n### Steve's Search for Meaning\n\nRecently I've been talking a lot about meaning, asking questions about the value of earning money, status anxiety, and company mission statements. Given that this is not the first time my brain has wadded its way into this territory, I am suspect that these concerns are \"real\" concerns, in that I don't actually care about the answers to these questions. I feel that it's much more likely that I am feeling unsettled for some external reasons (such as having less contact with people given all the reading I'm doing, or having less structure in my life), and am then looking for logical questions to focus my and others' attention on to explain away my unsettled internal state.\n\nWhen I shift my attention away from these questions, and back to my current plan of pickling myself in ideas, I feel much less anxiety: as long as I read a lot, and reflect on my reading, I'm following the plan. Another thing that abates my worries: the books and essays on my to-do list are first-class. In fact, it's difficult to find any to remove, and sometimes feels impossible to prioritize. My disquiet disappers entirely if I simply focus on enjoying the pinacle of pleasure that I have the luxury to enjoy by simply being allotted the time to dive into books that are interesting and potentially useful to me.

I'll be there Jan 15-19 2018. I've heard, read, and seen so many amazing things from there, and I'm pumped to see it all firsthand and play with it all. Hopefully I'll have some fun videos, writings, and/or podcasts for y'all from there soon!\n\n### Where have I been this week?\n\nI have not committed to this project/log/journal at all this week, which is directly contradicting my policy of contributing every day, except when otherwise specified. Part of the problem may be that it's unclear *where* I specify which days I have *on* vs *off*. Food for thought.\n\nAnyways, I've really taken this past week for vacation. I took my girlfriend to waterski on Monday, spent the day with my grandparents on Tuesday (six hours of grandparent technology help was fun!), and spend what was supposed to be my last day in FL with my mom and brother on Wednesday.\n\nWe were supposed to leave Thursday morning, but our flight was cancelled because of the snow. I spent the day packing and then unpacking my things and on the computer and then phone with Spirit airlines. Very fustrating.\n\nHowever today I have been working! I spent the morning on email, then had a fun chat with Paul Chiusano about education, and now am here. I plan to spend the next 90ish min here, then workout, then have dinner.\n\nGiven how unproductive we've been this past week, my girlfriend and I are considering spending this weekend (tomorrow and the next day) working too, so stay tuned on that front. No promies.\n\n### Reflecting on reflection 10\n\nI am overwhelmed by the size and scope of reflection 10. It's both too much to think about and also not fun to think about.\n\nAnd it's just plain embaressing, really indefensible to not get any work done because you're blocked on a reflection time. Apparently there was wisdom in the setup that I had before: Monday's are reflection days. You can only spend as much time as you have on a Monday. This is good because it forces me to not include all sorts of tangents.\n\nSo my current idea is to spend the next 90 minutes finishing reflection 10, of which the goal is to come up with a plan for the next two weeks before leaving to visit Dynamicland.\n\n#### Cleaning up reflection 10\n\nMake the BV deep dive section short. No re-reading of notes.\n\nRemove the Alan Kay / possiblitiy and income sections.\n\nKeep misc updates.\n\nThink about priorities.\n\nLet's do it!", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1514590238,

I had over 20GB on this machine - and the max size is 10BG! First I deleted all the large directories that I no longer use. Then I tried to figure out how to shrink this directory down.\n\nFirst I installed [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and tested it out on a single file. However, that file wasn't easily reachable in github pages, so that solution was out. And besides I think that was solving a different problem than the one I have.\n\nThen [this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/handle-big-repositories-git) helped me delete unneccesary files with git sparse-checkout. I still have a 350MB `.git` directory because they are probably storing those large files.\n\nHowever now I have 7GB of space on this machine and that should last a while if I just add text here from now on. Potentially I'm going to want to `git clone --shallow` this repo from scratch. The problem there is that I have to remember to bring over my config files in the `.git` directory. (It is a bummer that those files aren't more portable!)\n\n### Brief rant on \"overthinking\"\n\nOne of my least favorite words is \"overthinking.\" I firmly believe that whatever someone's problem is, thinking too much can never be the problem.\n\nWe all know people, maybe even ourselves, who have thought themselves into circles about relatively simple decisions. Clearly this person has a thinking problem, but the problem isn't that they are thinking too much: it's that they aren't thinking *well*.\n\nLet me prove it to you by contradiction. Say you are worried that  you are overthinking an issue in your life. How in the world are you supposed to be able to evaluate this claim? The only way is meta-cognition:  thinking about your thinking process. Through meta-cognition you may come to the conclusion that you have been doing too much *unproductive thinking*. But it would be impossible to say that you were doing too much thinking because the only way you were able to determine that you were thinking too much was more thinking!\n\nThis word \"overthinking\" feels appropriate when someone is doing too much of unhelpful kinds of thinking. Thus I propose we replace it with a new word. Let's say, you're \"thinking poorly.\" Ok, that's a bit harsh. Maybe \"thinking in circles\" is a better metaphor.\n\n### Cons and pros of my current schedule\n\nNow that I've gotten that off my chest, let's do some reflections on my process of reflecting.\n\nI set up this research schedule for myself 4ish months ago. I've learned a lot about how I work in that time. For the most part, I've liked this schedule. Let's reflect on what I don't like:\n\n* non-informative logistics around post production and publication for podcast episodes\n* feeling pressured to reflect, record, edit and publish reflections all in the morning on mondays\n\nThe pros of my current process:\n\n* re-reading my last reflection and journal entries from then until now is really useful\n\n### One question\n\n**What value does recording, editing, and publishing my research recap podcasts provide for me? (Not counting the reflecting I do to prepare to record.)**\n\nNone, save when others listen to it and then contact me to be friends.\n\nIn other words, I gain all of the value from simply doing the reflection in text, minus the people that listen to the podcast that wouldn't read my bi-weekly textual updates. Recording it on audio is simply for audio-only people.\n\nI wonder how many of those there are. I get about 100 downloads on most episodes. I'm not sure how many people actually listen to them after downloading. I used to have listeners contact me, but that has stopped. And I suspsect that many would've contacted me from the conversation episodes alone.\n\nHere's where podcasts shine: two-person conversations. A two person conversation requires little prep time and I usually learn a lot from the conversation. And the person I interview has an audience to spread me around to. (Although that hasn't really ever lead to much yet.)\n\nI'm thinking it makes sense to go to a 1 episode every other week as an interview plus Sam-Harris-style \"housekeeping\" section in the beginning if I have other things to say. For example, I can start my interview with Jason next week with housekeeping notes that I won't be doing research recaps any longer.\n\nWhat about people who want to read my bi-weekly reflections / status update?\n\nA few options.\n\nA) They can read them in the `reflections/` or `updates/` folder.\nB) I can create a TinyLetter bi-weekly newletter like Glen Chiacchieri.\n\nLet's start with (A) for now and see if anyone asks for a newsletter.\n\nOne final question: what's the plan for tomorrow's reflection?\n\nFirst of all, I won't be starting tomorrow's reflection until I finish my personal life reflection (which is private). I estimate that taking 1-4 hours tomorrow so I may not have time to do a reflection here until Tues or Weds.\n\nI definitely want to re-read the last two weeks of journal updates.\n\nI also want to read the prior reflection.\n\nI also want to re-read my plan.\n\nI feel finally ready to finish my work plan. It's basically [what it is now](./plan) plus [this section of my journal](http://futureofcoding.org/log#pickling-my-brain-is-a-lot-of-work).\n\nLet's try and finish my reflection first and publish it. Then I can decide what to do next: continue to BV deep dive, do \"deep thinking\", other \"FoC research\", or write the plan.", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1513561790, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513561788, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "00a5618a5a82198dca9529ceb20e16536351e152", "parents": ["dfebc82d97c9e9586dc7971e35af825725556eb8"], "commit": "94a1bb199095aa06cebeb77f2e09cc3d1193ba0c", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1513561788, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513561788, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "7cc0de6651019eedb9f8471c7a2628ea252242ee", "parents": ["8c4ccdf1f61bd3af8c0b9f86c16ded7ae88c95f7"], "commit": "dfebc82d97c9e9586dc7971e35af825725556eb8", "message": "removed git lfs;

Woke up at 7am, snoozed the alarm for 20 mintes, then set up my workspace for 20 minutes (adjusting the chair and computer heights), and got into it!\n\nThis morning I reviewed Evan Miller's _Don't Kill Math_ which was fun.\n\n#### Shower outline of \"climate change for conservatives\"\n\nThis outline shows how much I've internanlized both Nicky Case's know your audience and Scott Adam's persuation techniques. In short, as someone who's been skeptical of the left's portrayal of climate science, I communicated to people like me about ways to assimilate climate science into their existing mental models.\n\n![](/media/2017-12-14 10.17.30.jpg)\n\n\n### Learnable programming\n\nAfter the shower, I pushed myself to re-read Learable Programming. I was at first resistant because I've read it 2 or 3 times now, and the last time was only a few months ago. Almost immediately I realized that I definitely need to read this article again!\n\nThe things about it that surprised me this read:\n\n1. Video games as a vector for powerful mental models. Aligns incentives well in for-profit: people pay for games. Will Wright is a boss. Need to research Minecraft. Maybe go work for Will Wright or some amazing game maker. Or team up with Nicky on a game.\n2. I want to re-write Learnable Programming. I've already put down some thoughts about the re-write. It's mostly a more coherent and justifying able framing, as opposed to explaining the importance of a seemingly random assortment of virtues Bret specifies at the top of the article.\n\n\n### Reading vs writing polished work\n\nGiven that I'm producing outlines for two pieces this morning, in addition to all of the other content that I've been meaning to produce in a polished way, not to mention the backlog of blog ideas I have stuck in a Trello, I am beginning to wonder how I will balance my time as a reader and writer. Right now I'm in reading mode. I think the balance of writing as a form of note-taking is great during this mode. It will help in writing mode for sure. I wonder when I will feel the impetus to switch to writing mode. At the current moment it feels like there's so much for me to get into my head, including:\n\n* Alan Kays videos\n* re-reading Seymour Papert\n* Mountessouri\n* Marshall McLuhan\n* Piaget\n* Chris Granger\n* Nicky Case (again and more thoroughly)\n* John Dewey (I'm becomming obsessed with this guy)\n* F.M. Alexander (feels relevant to this project too)\n\nAnd then I have a dozen books in my apartment that are begging to be read, such as:\n\n* The Mythical Man Month\n* Two culture of the scientific revolution\n* Show your work\n* Society of Mind (minsky)\n* Theory of Fun for video game design\n\nGiven my current pace (assuming I'm not sick and continue to mostly read and not protoype), I feel like this reading will take more than a month but less than a year, which is very reasonable. The only worry is that the more I read, the more I will want to read because I'll want to continue walking the tree up to influence of influences of influences, eventually getting up to Plato or even the Torah.\n\n#### [Pickling my brain](http://futureofcoding.org/plan#1-pickle-myself) is a lot of work!\n\nAs Feynman says, [there are no miracle people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIDLcaQVMqw.) If you want to be smart you merely have to do what smart people did to become smart. It seems like smart people do a lot of reading. What they're actually doing is assimilating models into their heads. Then when they're not reading they are playing with those models.\n\nIt's a blessing and a curse that there are so many amazing models out there today. It's a blessing because we can be so much smarter than any person in history. It's a curse because if we want to be one of the smartest people of today, there's a lot of pickling to be done!\n\nThe next time someone implies that I was born this smart, I will need to give them a piece of my mind: \"Do you know how much work it takes to be this smart?! Day in and day out I read and write and read and write. Just like an athlete trains the body, I train my mind every day, all day.\"\n\nJoesph Campbell:\n\n> I would get in nine hours of sheet reading done a day. And this went on for five years straight... Reading what you want, and having one book lead to the next, is the way I found my discipline. I've suggested this to many of my students: When you find a writer who really is saying something to you, read everything that writer has written and you will get more education and depth of understanding out of that than reading a scrap here and a scrap there and elsewhere. Then go to people who influenced that writer, or those who were related to him, and your world builds in an organic way that is really marvelous.\n\n(Wow, reading more of this snipet is amazing stuff! Now I'm excited to read this whole book where I found this quote!)\n\nIt's interesting to note here I was already following this strategy before knowing about his advice. It's quite vindicating to know that this strategy worked for someone else. And if it takes me 5 years, that's ok too. I'll just have to find some way to make it financially sustainable...", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"], [0, 51, "essays/invented-or-discoved.md"], [51, 0, "essays/invented-or-discovered.md"], [0, 111, "notes/bret-victor/bret-victor.md"], [128, 0, "notes/bret-victor/index.md"], [142, 0, "notes/bret-victor/learnable-programming.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1513261232, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513261232, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "373e98d04e224a07e4c5ba66d8b00f75908c3e07", "parents": ["019b0d133655caf6a9ebab43b68a2807c421f5f2", "a3fd85acfae5318f04d23b36d91941398e789a96"], "commit": "3264fb7c248f0dc57df83a1c01cdd94cc3eea6df", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1513261225, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513261222, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "76e682f6dd4fc4a4b50999916ab777af683705c6", "parents": ["740cb7efb4bbea260db198af51a7d0692ed84fba"], "commit": "019b0d133655caf6a9ebab43b68a2807c421f5f2", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1513261222, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513261222, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "e110d9d62a0384056143480d2492c3354c3d71d6", "parents": ["8674e0e5c21ca689ffba5f31aab7203cd5b1d4db"], "commit": "740cb7efb4bbea260db198af51a7d0692ed84fba", "message": "continuing BV deep dive", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"], [13, 2, "notes/bret-victor/bret-victor.md"], [23, 0, "notes/bret-victor/kill-math.md"], [30, 0, "notes/halfway-there-cis-240.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1513194223, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513194221, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "93ba132a5f0a4744bac0132afa41bbde42491699", "parents": ["5d53ed3612481bd02b3504fdeadd90529cb675ba"], "commit": "8674e0e5c21ca689ffba5f31aab7203cd5b1d4db", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1513194221, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513194221, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "902babe211f0661f8437f061cf3158b79912895e", "parents": ["08e1c27da7d2a07cd79009ee2afb0dadd2907ba6"], "commit": "5d53ed3612481bd02b3504fdeadd90529cb675ba", "message": "added shower notes photo", "changes": [["-", "-", "media/2017-12-13 12.45.20 (1).jpg"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1513194008, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513189783, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "0e6ae4505641b69ad17bb5fa2fcfa383c2bc1ebb", "parents": ["795d267ff7107bd5f6ad895735c0390386860fdb"], "commit": "08e1c27da7d2a07cd79009ee2afb0dadd2907ba6", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1513189783, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1513189783, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "3d076c84ece35a013b96fb25a1fabec5872952ac", "parents": ["b929b7ef8660c7c5345975b8303ef429c238c42d"], "commit": "795d267ff7107bd5f6ad895735c0390386860fdb", "message": "## Back (again)\n\n* TOC\n{: toc }\n\n^ I wonder if the above generates a table of contents in the markdown.\n\n### Sick (again)\n\nIt's deja-vu all over again. I fell back off the horse again for the same reason. It looks like I've had strep throat, on an off for the past 2 months. We're not 100% sure but our prevailing theory is that my girlfriend and I keep passing it back and forth to each other, which is how I still have it even after taking 10 days of antibotics. Now we're both on antibiotics so I feel confident that we're kicking this sickness for good this time.\n\n### Getting back into things (again)\n\nIt's definitely tricky going from sick-mode (which is similar to relax-mode) to work mode, or vice-versa. Once in a mode, it's easy to maintain it, but the transitions are tricky, particularly when they are un-expected. Usually the transition goes smoother when you admit that you're transitioning.\n\nFor example, last night I stayed up to midnight, watched too much TV, had too much to eat for dinner, and had too much snack food after dinner. I woke up this morning feeling almost hung over. I was tired and everything hurt. Contrast this with how I go to bed when I'm in work mode: asleep before 11pm, eat a reasonable meal, none or a small dessert, 1 or 2 episodes of TV, maybe reading, definitely not a movie.\n\n### Scattered thoughts\n\nAs happened last time I got sick, my thoughts seem to have scattered and I feel quite directionless. I feel like I've forgotten why I'm doing a Bret Victor deep dive, as compared with all of the other branches of the tree I could go down.\n\n\n#### Chat with Stefan\n\nIt was really helpful to chat with Stefan Lesser this morning for a few reasons:\n\n1. He was very bright and optimistic, almost cheery. I got a very warm feeling from him. I wonder if it's related to him listening to my podcast because I get a similar feeling from Aidan.\n\n2. We think in very similar ways. Talking to my girlfriend about these ideas is like pulling teeth because we don't speak the same languages. She speaks the artist langauge and I speak the programmer langauge. But Stefan and I can communicate very fluidly. More than that we agree on so many points. It's very validating. I imagine that's part of why working in a research lab, like PARC or Dyanmicland, is so inspiring. Shared vision. Fast communication.\n\n#### Shower Note Session\n\nI was overflowing with thoughts to such a degree, and I was cold to such a degree, that I decided to do one of my famous shower brainstorm sessions. This was definitely one of my more scattered ones:\n\n![](/media/2017-12-13 12.45.20 (1).jpg)\n\nThere's almost too many thoughts and directions in all of those notes. While it was fun and energizing to write them, I am now intimidated by their quantity and scope and don't feel like engaging or proccessing them now. Content overflow is definitley one of my main themes of this project.\n\n### Looking ahead\n\n#### Things on the horizon:\n\n* I have ~3 hours today, ~8 hours tomorrow, and ~3 hours Friday\n* On Friday I go home to Florida for 3 weeks\n* Jan 8 - 12 I will hopefully (just applied) be at [the 1-week Recurse Center program](https://www.recurse.com/blog/121-come-to-rc-for-a-one-week-retreat)\n* Jan 19 - 26 I plan to visit Dynamicland in Oakland\n* I have 2 years of runway before I need to get a job (living in NYC)\n\n#### Thoughts on /plan v5\n\nI felt much more centered after re-reading [my most recent plan](/plan) this\nmorning. My thoughts are:\n\n##### 1. Justify cause/crusade framing\n\nThe cause/crusade framing feels so obvious to me, but definitely not to many others. I want to dig into these feelings a bit more. Think about why prinicpled, conscious, purposeful creation is \"better\" than simply doing stuff for money or more whimsical reasons.\n\n##### 2. Still blocked on philosophy\n\nHow do I know that I'm still blocked here? Because I can't make decisions. I had a great call with Jaime Brandon yesterday. It was very easy for him to diagnose this problem in me because he's faced it himself, as well as seeing it at Eve. When you're too broad, when you don't have good priorities or boundaries, you agonize over each decision, and constantly want to walk up and down the tree. A good project can easily see what it is and what it is not, and doesn't spend much time thinking about paths it didn't take in the tree because *that is not what it is*. A thing in the world defines itself by the path it takes. What it is and what it is not. Staying up in prototype/research land is refusing to do that. Even within prototype/research land, I feel constant agony about what is the priority to research or prototype or communicate or build.\n\nI feel my brain wanting to escape this proccess. I feel it looking for the easy out. Looking for a quick answer it can sub in here so we can get back to more structure, a more easily optimizable game. On the one hand, I applaud my brain for this strategy, because the less unknowns you're working with at one time, the better. Yet on the other hand, I feel like if I took an easy route such as getting a job at a company, I would immediately wish I was back here, working on my own philosophy, as opposed to actualizing someone else's, which I would constanatly be picking apart.\n\nThus, the appeal of the ultimate escape hatch on this procecss: go work for someone who's vision is so clearly better than anything I could come up with at the moment. The candidates for this position are few and far between: Alan Kay, Bret Victor, maybe someone at Bret's lab, maybe Paul Chiusano. We shall see what happens here when I visit Dnyamicland soon.\n\n###### Constructing Meaning\n\nI went deep into this rabbit hole in my shower brainstorm. I have defined a crusade as the most meaningful thing I can do. This is explicitly not the most good I can do from the Juan Benet / Elon Musk / Peter Singer perspective. Yet if this is the case, and it's truly subjective. Then I better be damn sure I know what is meaningful to me. That's why I started making a list of all of my positive memories that held meaning in my life. (It reminded me that my fustration with Looker was that I can't remember a single decision any one made because of a Looker report. In my experience, the tool was analytics for analytis sake.)\n\nThen I got into a hole where I realized that the difficult thing with children as customer is that their incentives are so perverse given the structure we place them in. For example part of why I hate tutoring is that either students are un-motivated or motivated for the wrong reasons (grades), or motivated to just get the end product to show off and thus just want me to program it. It's rare (but happens sometimes) to find a student in the right context: working because they enjoy making something and getting better at making things.\n\nI'm also thinking about the condescending nature of this whole project, particularly the bait-and-switch part, where you sell a product that does X, but only because you have an ulterior motive Y. Sell electric sports cars to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. Part of me wants to just give it up and go wherever there's the most money. Stop trying to be so normative. Just let people tell you what it is they want and then deliver it. That's not to say that you should blindly listen to customers. It's that you should iterate with customers towards something they will pay a lot for because it solves a big problem for them. Put another way, Looker clearly is solving a massive problem for tens of thousands of people at thousands of companeis. It's truly software through empathy, as Lloyd talks about. Who am I to tell the world what's best for it? In other words, I better have a strong and well-thought-out philosophy for how to make thw world better if I am going to try my hand at shaping it through technology. Otherwise, I might as well just go where the market is because that's garunteed to make people better off (if you assume markets do that).\n\n#### Priorities for Dec and Jan\n\n##### 1) Life priorities\n\nMy main focus for my own health is the Alexander Technique.\n\nFor my family, particularly in the context of the 3-weeks in Florida, the focus is making the most of the time, in the context of others. This means that I want to * strategize ahead of time* to set myself up for success, but *be content in the moment*, even if it feels like a waste of time. In other words, 1) don't see people just because they asked to see you, 2) go to bed early and wake up early, 3) phsyically seperate from others when trying to focus, 4) calendar sculpt. The main priority here is \"peace in the home\", which is a Jewish saying. This is not the time for arguments and figuring things out. It's a powder keg. This is the time for making nice. Reflect later. Figure things out later.\n\n##### 2) Work priorities (12/13/17 - 1/8/18)\n\nCalm, coherent, patient, doing less. The opposite of frenetic. That's my goal. Re-reading my /plan embued me with calm and happiness. Meditating, coming back to my journal to reflect. These are the things that add the structure I need in this purposefully unstructured time.\n\nI can't see any reason to stop my Bret Victor deep dive given that I still have at least half a dozen links to go. I feel like I've lost steam on it, but that might just be a momentum thing. Could return when I get back into it.\n\nI don't want to start doing priority-calculus, seeing if there are other things to read that are slightly more efficient uses of my time.\n\nHowever, I wonder if I should budget more time in my calendar for \"deep thinking.\" I set aside a place in my Inbox (Google Inbox) for notes that I should proccess later. It's the \"deep thinking\" label. I feel like my time for thinking those thoughts has been crowded out by an urgency to finish the Bret deep dive.\n\nNow that I mention it... while this next thought does go against my intention not to play priority-calculus... I have a lot of links in various places that could use some attention, including /links as well as the \"foc research\" label in my Inbox. At the very least I could clean this up a bit and figure out a home for them.\n\nFinally, there clearly are top-of-mind topics that I could keep in a prioritized list somewhere. Basically, the next version of /ideas. These are Blockly++, FRP Scratch/WoofJS, StreamSheets, CycleJS devtools, FRP research incl Reflex & Conol Elliot, essay about essays, better wiki tool, etc.\n\nOk, I need to go eat lunch now. With the remaining 2 hours in the day (given that I spent an hour on this journal entry), I will:\n\n1. Get to inbox zero\n2. Publish Joe Cohen interview\n\nThe plan for tomorrow is:\n\n1. Deep thinking notes procecssing\n2. Calendar sculpting for vacation time\n3. Bret Victor deep dive (unless I come up with anything better)\n4.

"Writing about, more than reading, Kill Math\n\nToday I wrote ~3000 words about the ~1500 words I read of Bret Victor's Kill Math essay. Clearly it was thought-provoking. This is slightly misleading because I also re-read Chris Granger's Coding is Not the New Literacy as well as an article about Kill Math. Yet, the fact remains that I had a lot to say about these thoughts!\n\nGiven that I was still feeling under the weather today, I didn't workout which gave me lots more time today to do things like make a doctor appointments, as well as do a few clearerthinking.org quizes, and a few emails. I'm in a positive, we-can-solve-it-with-science mood now, which is definitely responsible for, or was caused by, all my discursive writing this morning.\n\nI got in about 4 hours of reading/writing here and 4 hours of miscellaneous tasks, which was less reading/writing than I planned for today but the other tasks were useful so I am happy with it. Tomorrow I only have 3 hours for reading/writing here, and also the aforementioned dentist, as well as a podcast interview, and two meetings.", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"], [98, 0, "notes/bret-victor/kill-math.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512578110, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512578107, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "d9b494a829e9d514ae0bbd0640f878345f57382a", "parents": ["54cf22660ff47b1ca1129df0ccc67ba65862a60c"], "commit": "58cee5d088081bf16341feea3a26541125879709", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512578107, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512578107, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "b602dd11e425636ecfd4f453ba3d75e9aec07eb1", "parents": ["c9376e095c1be7a7aea325c41d68d3b3d915e81f"], "commit": "54cf22660ff47b1ca1129df0ccc67ba65862a60c", "message": "added outline of legal code essay", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"], [38, 0, "essays/legal-code.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512521198, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512521196, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "7b635961a79e02e6b079db7b522a29dcfb95d59c", "parents": ["385906bee4d4c560dc87fd91c12d2fc1e670f40c"], "commit": "c9376e095c1be7a7aea325c41d68d3b3d915e81f", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512521196, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512521196, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "b5550c22f6b4bf1daf4fa31fc37ae2de0a8b9167", "parents": ["665d1f1714b93d45f2f3821b005078f8873469b2"], "commit": "385906bee4d4c560dc87fd91c12d2fc1e670f40c", "message": "added link to github commit in log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"], [5, 2, "log.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512520310, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512520307, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "50249711bc953306b6aa1aeb8838ddc5ffe01d80", "parents": ["313083992740638d7ae6304222261a4bd8f3f579"], "commit": "665d1f1714b93d45f2f3821b005078f8873469b2", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512520307, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512520307, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "811c954f7b2eaad28946d2f79430d3a9cd2152d7", "parents": ["f7b54344d5e8c2cc8a5b395f684148bffc0a6744"], "commit": "313083992740638d7ae6304222261a4bd8f3f579", "message": "custom log file is looking prettier!", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"], [26, 8, "log.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512513479, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512512710, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "73e5606dae115964b8218b34481a65c15f3ae82e", "parents": ["a50fa35752b94cefcfa9eb1507cc081fa247974a"], "commit": "f7b54344d5e8c2cc8a5b395f684148bffc0a6744", "message": "updated git log", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512512710, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512512710, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "9ac9d1db32eacbd8ff31a5634286fe5ae1a34f50", "parents": ["328eb7d1c3abf25ff159d9057352c697866157c7"], "commit": "a50fa35752b94cefcfa9eb1507cc081fa247974a", "message": "# Bret Victor Deep Dive!\n\n## Bret Victor Folder\n\nI created an entire folder inside my notes directory. I took so many notes on just Magic Ink](/notes/magic-ink) that it seemed like a good idea to have a seperate file for each piece of his work.\n\n## Tired, and maybe sick\n\nThis was a long day! I worked for most of the last 10 hours, and most, at least 7 hours, was reading and writing about Bret's projects. I am exhausted, partially because my throat is hurting :( I've really been sick with this thing for a while now! Let me schedule a doctor's appointment now for tomorrow... Ok, I got an appointment for 4pm tomorrow.\n\n### Trust & doctors\n\nI wish I had a doctor that I trusted, from a philosophical perspective, as much as I trust my Alexander Technique teacher Rebecca. I have trouble understanding the way doctors think, diagnose and cure things -- partially because they go through so much formal training that I didn't have, whereas Alexander Technique was something that a non-medical person created simply from personal analysis.\n\n## So many of my ideas\n\nIn particular I was shocked by how many of my favorite ideas *Bret also wrote about*, including a better medium for mathmatics, including for school children, LogicHub, a wiki-like platform for understanding and argumentation with nested sources.\n\n# Custom Log\n\nI'm really really excited about the work I did on my custom log file yesterday. That was pure fun. Later in the night, I opened it up just to admire it. Hope to work on that again soon!\n\n# Tomorrow (12/6/17)\n\nShould have 5 hours to continue here with the deep dive as long as I am not feeling too sick.", "changes": [[1, 1, "_data/git-log.json"],

I found [a free version](https://pastebin.com/BiFE2fUX) and have [answered the first part of it in not-bold here](/notes/future-authoring) and am taking his advice to wait until a night or two of sleep before doing the second part. Let me put time on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to tackle it.\n\nIt went really well! A lot of it was personal stuff about my life, but readers of my stream-of-consciousness style in this journal are not strangers to that. It feels relevant at times to talk about my life in this journal and this is one of those times. I am a bit worried it may bite me in the butt at some point down the line but that's just fear talking. I don't have any concrete worries here.\n\n## Crusade Discovery\n\n### Well and thoroughly pickled\n\nIn particular I think I made a shockingly large amount of progress on articulating my crusade this morning. And the way I came to it is really a function of a week well sculpted. (I love this phrase, by the way, calendar sculpting. A quick google search makes it seem like I have indeed inventing this phrase. I wonder if it'll catch on.)\n\nFor example, starting my week of thinking about how communication works for my \"essay about essays\" with Nicky Case lead me to Douglas Hofstader's \"Analogy as the Core of Cognition\" which was *exactly* what I needed to read right now, as well as re-reading Seymour Papert's \"Gears of my Childhood\", also exactly what I need to read right now. (Watching Bret Victor's Inventing on Principle last week also played a big part on my thinking this week.)\n\nThen Wednesday diving even deeper into how the brain works, how people learn, why they'd want to learn to code, etc with my coggle brain mapping was amazing. Really helped me spread out my thoughts in space and get clearer about them and how they relate and build upon each other.\n\nThursday my brain was on fire reading through the Dynamicland zine the first way through. I've only made it 4 pages in the second way through and have written ~3.5k words already. I was able yesterday to really *live* in the future and imagine what it would be like, without hating or \"making wrong\" the present. I was able to bask in the possibility while also being grateful for reality. The thing about truly living in the future, while accepting the present, is that you can do it all the time, and it's only when you live with things as core components of your life that you are able to imagine the next step, how to build on top of them, how they interact together, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th level causes. I was even ambitious enough to explain to both my grandma and then my mom about my vision for the future and how it relates to tools and humans and augmentation, etc. They both got it to some degree and were excited that I was excited and I learned more for explaining these thoughts to lay people.\n\nI also had a great conversation with my buddy Jonathan Leung yesterday where he was excited for me for \"not making the present wrong\" because he noticed it was something for me to work on when we did our podcast many months ago. We thought about Elon as a crusader and what his crusade is (averting existential threats) and how that compares with Juan Benets crusade (decentralization).\n\nAdditionally, yesterday was largely inspired by *How to Measure Anything*, my new favorite book which is really going to make a scientist out of me and helped me understand the distinction of mesaurement and how it is truly what science is: reduction in uncertainty.\n\nAs the zine says (quoting someone), the idea is to immerse myself if brilliant thoughts get pickled by all these ideas, which will in turn lead me to having my own ideas.\n\n### Ariculating Crusade\n\nI think here's what's profound about the ideas I had yesterday and today:\n\n0) Tools, or technology, includes ideas, ananlogies, physical machines, virtual software. Anything that allows someone to do or think things, either at all or easier, than without the tool.\n\n1) Humans subsume our tools into ourselves, becoming what we were before plus our new tool. The result is a cohesive whole. Removing the tool reduces the human to what they were before the tool, akin to removing a person's arms.\n\n2) We know a great deal about how the mind works, how our bodies work, how emotions and happiness works, as well as what doesn't work. We can take all of this knowledge and bring it to bear on the problem of desigining proper tools for humans.\n\n*Pause!* How does this relate to programming language tools? Well programming langauges are *tools for designing tools*. Wow. Has there ever been such a tool? Ok, well writing is a tool for desigining tools. The notion of tool is a tool. Ok, so there are plenty. Programming is a tool for desigining tools *that can also desigin itself*. That's pretty neat: you can't make a pencil with a pencil. You can't make a typewritter with a typewritter. But you can make software tools with software tools.\n\nHowever it doesn't feel like *the bootstrapibility of programming languages* is why I'm so passionate about improving programming tools. Let's flip the question on its head: am I more passionate about building better tools for programming than, say, science? Or better dinner table conversations? Or more logical thinking? Nope. I'm really excited about each of those problems. Maybe the dinner table one a bit less emotionally but not that much less. The only reason I was so excited about programming tools was that 1) they were problems I had, 2) they were problems my students had, 3) I knew how to code and would have fun solving them. I'm really excited about all tools for thought and how to really embed them inside of people so that people can *be* augmented, not just be augmented.\n\nWait is that my crusade? *Be* augmented. The metaphor is that we are already the bionic man. We already have technology in our brains. We might as well optimize this software as best we can. And make the technology outside our brains optimal as well because that technology *exists inside our brains too*, just not phsyically. The metaphor for that is 1) my arm isn't \"inside my body\", but it's clearly me and 2) same goes for my clothes.\n\n## Rest of today\n\nI'm going to go workout with Sarah at a barre class now and then grab lunch. The idea this afternoon is to try my hand at another draft of my plan. I think I've got a good head on my shoulders about it this time.\n\nHowever, I think I'll probably want to come back to it after I finish the future authoring and get through my Bret Victor deep dive. Really, my plan seems like it might be done in time for the new year.", "changes": [[428, 0, "notes/future-authoring.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512075918, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512075918, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "2582fea65fc2fbecbb2cffe96b9f26cf92df1473", "parents": ["843401057ce8a2b49c13946d75528cc91efe23f4", "0bbbd72360272f908d95ad982c100b683f83731e"], "commit": "e399b6f639205cc40e7e4cc8b08382200864c3a5", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1512074943, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512074943, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "2582fea65fc2fbecbb2cffe96b9f26cf92df1473", "parents": ["a7cd8ae602c1b11e44a0e025a9a45e32c2cbc29c"], "commit": "843401057ce8a2b49c13946d75528cc91efe23f4", "message": "# Read Dynamicland Zine (& merge commit)\n\nAs you can tell by [reading my notes](/notes/dynamicland-zine.md), I was blown away by the Dynamicland zine.\n\n## Things on my mind\n\n### Markdown headers in commit messages\n\nThis is important so that I can link to content via its anchor tag. (Yes this currently doesn't work because this content is currently not rendered as in the github commits page for this repo. I will need to do that at some point soon-ish.)\n\nThis was bothering me so much that I solved it right now. It's as simple as `git commit --cleanup=verbatim` and then just deleting everything but the message. Closing https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org/issues/62.\n\n### Next steps\n\nIt's becomming clearer that my next steps revolve around Bret Victor and Dynamicland. At the very least I need to spend a few hours there, but I could see it being weeks, months or even a year or two.\n\nThis week I worked on:\n\n1) brainstorm \"essay about essays\"\n2) brainstorm \"learn to code\" essay\n3) read and reflect on zine\n4) reflect on goals and work on long-term plan (tomorrow)\n\nThis was a really great week. However, I'm now seeing my work on the \"learn to code\" essay as potentially premature. Or not premature, but not quite as urgent as I thought. It's not like I'm going to forget my hardwon insights from The Coding Space. While I could write something now, I am only going to learn more about these topics as time goes on. And I can always come back to teaching if I need to remember things for the essay.\n\nThe \"essay about essays\" project is also a bit random. However, if Nicky Case would collaborate with me on it, I would drop all my other projects and jump at that chance.\n\nHowever, if left to my own devices, it feels like its time for a Bret Victor deep dive, much like the Alan Kay deep dive that I did a few months back. (You can read about it in [my old journal.](/journal)) Like my Alan Kay deep dive, this one will likely also take approximately two weeks (12/04/17-12/15/17). Then I go home for three weeks (12/18/17-1/4/18) for the holidays. I might do some (no more than 20 hours) work the week of 12/18/17.\n\nThen it's time for a visit to Dynamicland! https://twitter.com/mandy3284/status/936284579333156864\n\nI'll probably go in early Jan, but it depends on when they want me I guess. I'd love to stay for a week or two and work out of the space every day, but I'd be happy to go for even a single afternoon.\n\nAll this said, while I have set aside all day tomorrow to work on my goals and my plan, I may cut that short if it doesn't feel productive to get a head start on my new priority: the Bret Victor deep dive!", "changes": [[1, 0, "index.html"], ["-", "-", "media/Screenshot 2017-11-30 at 8.29.34 AM.png"], ["-", "-", "media/Screenshot 2017-11-30 at 8.37.44 AM.png"], ["-", "-", "media/Screenshot 2017-11-30 at 8.49.55 AM.png"], ["-", "-", "media/dynamicland.pdf"], [134, 0, "notes/dynamicland-zine.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1512047045, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1512047045, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "e7301d6ef4e42868d7f4d47f2f907e53bf255d0f", "parents": ["6b867d3c889181eeb103e7cc14686657245680e3"], "commit": "a7cd8ae602c1b11e44a0e025a9a45e32c2cbc29c", "message": "notes with aidan", "changes": [[33, 0, "notes/aidan-cunniffe-call-11-29-17.md"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1511909201, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1511909201, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "822af65d8e7988f763ad6d2c1e8db597e6940f6b", "parents": ["4b45eec96cf6567d087b53ecac4c704391aa8bc4", "1347f142280fac483b648cb2b1ef72d9d0b2c93d"], "commit": "6b867d3c889181eeb103e7cc14686657245680e3", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org", "changes": []}, {"committer": {"date": 1511909196, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1511909196, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "32db7a6dcda691defd53a9cb304e8a17b9931241", "parents": ["fcb70a6ebb26033a3dcb308929ca277145f286b8"], "commit": "4b45eec96cf6567d087b53ecac4c704391aa8bc4", "message": "added episdeo 17 bubble.is emmanuel", "changes": [[87, 0, "episodes/17-bootstrapping-bubble-is-emmanuel-straschnov.html"], [1, 0, "index.html"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1511884759, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1511884759, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "9a0896eba57588b77ba6ce874aa1b7cbf747d303", "parents": ["8274ccb120bb3781402aed0a9e1d99242b95a479"], "commit": "fcb70a6ebb26033a3dcb308929ca277145f286b8", "message": "Back from sickness and vacation\n\nThe past two weeks didn't go as planned. If you're following this journal, you'll notice that I haven't made any entires or commits for two weeks. This was mostly because I was still(!) feeling sick. Finally I was diagnosed with strep throat, and am feeling a lot better today. Tomorrow is my last dose of antibiotics so hopefully I'll get back to running tomorrow or the day after.\n\nNote: [the entry prior to this one](https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org/commit/8274ccb120bb3781402aed0a9e1d99242b95a479) is fairly defeated in tone. This is because (1) I was unexpectedly starting to feel sick (again) and didn't want to believe it, and (2) I was trying to get too much done in the time allotted. A recipe for defeatedness. I'm feeling much better about things now. Plenty of things to do but one step at a time. Plenty of time to address them all. Most important ones first.\n\nDespite what it says in my plan at the moment, my next step will not be creating a Patreon. This is because (1) the value accrued from having a Patreon up before creating my content probably isn't that high (look at how Vi Hart raised $6k in just a few days on her reputation), (2) it takes a while to get a strong following on a Patreon so the money wouldn't mean much, (3) it's a distraction from focusing on the work the will actually help move me forward at this juncture (planning, reading, writing).\n\nI'm very excited about a potential upcomming collaboration with Nicky Case. On our phone call a few weeks back, I asked him for advice on writing essays and he outline his thoughts in what will hopefully be an essay he and I collab on. That sounds like a lot of fun! It would be great to have a small win under my belt. Despite it likely not being the absolute highest priority right now, it's in the right direction. In other words, even though my Work Plan isn't quite done, I still have a pretty strong feeling that this small detour would move me closer to accomplishing it. As I told Nicky, I have ~20 hours this week to work on the essay. But really there's no rush. I can work on other things this week and come back to that next week.\n\nAnother thing on my mind is the unbreakable-links project. This project has taken much longer than expected. Just another opportunity for me to improve my currently highly inaccurate planning skills. The short-term solution is quite reasonable: whenever I want to move or delete a file in this directory, I simply have to think through what will happen to all prior links to that page. I do this well with the now deprecated /journal page.\n\nOk, so now let me think about my priorities:\n\n* Write 3 different outlines for the \"essay about essays\" to send to Nicky Case\n* Publish the now-very-late podcast with Emmanuel from bubble\n* Spend time writing about my goals for this project\n* Deep dive on Bret, read the Zine, send him an email\n* Write 3 outlines about learning/teaching to code (and learning in general)\n* Continue writing FoC plan\n* Schedule meetings with key people (Aidan, Stefan, Samuel)\n* Migrate other blogs from Trello (including AT essay outline)\n* Reach out to guest or two for next week on the podcast\n\nOk, these are all top priorities that need to happen in the next week or so. The order I do them in doesn't matter much. Let's go ahead and put them on my calendar in blocks, so I can visualize what I can get done and move them around as needed.\n\nThis is what it looks like now:\n\n![screenshot 2017-11-28 at 10 52 36 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/33329341-51f477f0-d42a-11e7-9091-4d6d3a72a3ff.png)\n\nI'm feeling happy and aligned with this. I am now noticing that this would be in contradiction with what I told Casey, that I have ~20 hours for this project. Depending on how our conversation goes, I can always bump one of these blocks to next week no problem and manufacture 20 hours here. However this is the plan if he doesn't want to work on this this week.\n\nYou may have noticed that I'm more structured today than usual. This is (1) because I have not been regular about my entries the past few weeks and am feeling a bit adrift, and (2) I fell into a Jordan Peterson YouTube hole last night and he says some pretty straightforward things about happiness, including that you need structure. The first question he asks someone who's depressed is, \"do you have a job?\" If the answer is no, then his answer is get one, even if it's not perfect. It will set you up for success. So while I don't want to follow the letter of his advice, I do want to add a little more structure to my life to stave off any kind of emotional turmoil from working alone and jobless.", "changes": [[1, 1, "plan.md"], [2, 0, "unbreakable-links/index.js"]]}, {"committer": {"date": 1510614499, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "author": {"date": 1510614499, "timezone": "+0000", "name": "Steve Krouse", "email": "skrouse@seas.upenn.edu"}, "tree": "b5f21eaa3e0f28380ca58cce45dc9c957c3495b4", "parents": ["a3056b4b08d8c31e471945c7f68ae9695afc3614"], "commit": "8274ccb120bb3781402aed0a9e1d99242b95a479", "message": "Why is my plan so ugly?\n\nI was hoping to publish my work plan by the end of day today but I don't like it.

That's not neccesarily a bad thing.\n\n* It's such a bummer to me that I have to write these journal thoughts somewhere random and then copy and paste them into the commit message at the end of my work even though I'm now writing them before I get started. Why can't the commit have a home before you finish the commit?! (Brainflash! I should've just commited the above thoughts to the repo without any changes this morning!)\n\n* Version control is definitely a topic I want to think about more. Really \"version control\" isn't the write word for it. It's more \"iterating on software\" or \"the software workflow\". Managing versions of software is a different problem. The elements of change guy is really the only one I know who's really thinking about this in a thoughtful way.\n\n* I'm not sure where my fustration with this plan is coming from: 1) my lack of progress on it the last few weeks because of my sickness and taking too many meetings, or 2) not having enough data to make a good decision here.", "changes": [["-", "-",

Unfortunately, I was able to do none of that, but I did find the energy to work on https://github.com/stevekrouse/unbreakable-links which is both important to work on and a very fun project for me.\n\nToday I'm feeling a lot better, but I still don't want to push myself, especially because I want to conserve my energy for the MoMath fundraiser that I was invited to by Pete Muller when I bumped into him at Springsteen on Broadway and he heard that I'm a Mitch Resnick fan, and that he'll be there tonight! I'll have to make sure to finish his book in the next few hours...\n\nAs far as my main focus, my #1 priority these days is my Planning Series, which starts with \"Life Plan\", then \"World Plan\", and finally \"Future of Coding Plan\".
