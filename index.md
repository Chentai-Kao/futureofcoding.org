This community was originally started by [Steve Krouse](https://stevekrouse.com). From 2017 to 2019, Steve maintained an open-ended [log](/log) of his research as an experiment in radical transparency. For a summary of his research goals, check the [about page](/about). In the fall of 2019, he created [The Whole Code Catalog](/catalog). It includes detailed reviews of 24 programming-ish interfaces and experiments. Check it out for inspiration and ideas-to-steal. Below, you'll find a number of his published works.
