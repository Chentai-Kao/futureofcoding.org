Not sure what we're all about? If you're new to _reimagining computing_, a good frame of reference is [Week 3 & 4 of Chris Novello's _Computer Utopias_ curriculum](http://chrisnovello.com/teaching/risd/computer-utopias/).

<br>

The podcast features interviews with toolmakers, researchers, computational artists, and others with fruitful viewpoints on what the future of computing holds.

This community was originally started by [Steve Krouse](https://stevekrouse.com). From 2017 to 2019, Steve maintained an open-ended [log](/log) of his research as an experiment in radical transparency. For a summary of his research goals, check the [about page](/about). In the fall of 2019, he created [The Whole Code Catalog](/catalog). It includes detailed reviews of 24 programming-ish interfaces and experiments. Check it out for inspiration and ideas-to-steal. Finally, Steve has also published a number of [Essays & Papers](/essays-papers) that you may find interesting.

At the end of 2019, Steve decided to focus more on his research work and other interests, and passed the stewardship of the community and podcast hosting duties to Ivan Reese ([Website](https://ivanish.ca) â€¢ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spiralganglion)).
