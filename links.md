  * really great advise on running research community
    * vision, not goals
    * fund people, not projects
    * research community, not research project
    * fund problem finding, not just problem solving
    * milestones, not deadlines
    * be ok with high failure rate
    * just two years for the person running the group
    * solve the problem, don't think about what you can do with the tools you have. make the tools if you need to
    * argue for clarity, not to win
