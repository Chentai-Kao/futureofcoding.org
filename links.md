## Researched

* [Ken Perlin on Chalktalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuzrF_82z7U)
  * professor at NYU
  * making magic real with AR/VR. A combo of harold with a crayon and harry potter
  * he has a really interesting medium like Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad that allows you to create and link together dynamic diagrams. It feels too good to be true, like it was over optimized for this one presentation. I want to see the code on github 
  
* [Jonathan Edwards: Two-way Dataflow](https://vimeo.com/97684085)
  * looks like this turned into [Chorus](http://www.chorus-home.org/)
  * his todomvc example isn't half bad, although I think the react, one-way databinding way that Cycle v2 uses is more in style these days
  * seems like Lamdu does a good job of implementing [his vision for easy-to-use static typing]https://vimeo.com/74314050)
  
* [Francisco Sant’Anna: Dynamic Organisms in Céu](https://vimeo.com/97687022)
  * seems similar to my idea of making a reactive version of Woof or an Elm game engine
  
* [Patrick Dubroy: Moonchild](https://vimeo.com/97711824)
  * I've seen this before. Neat project
  * Allow you to incrementally turn a code editor into a GUI editor, with things like color pickers. It'd be neat if we had this on woofjs.com, so students could see the color in their code and use the color picker right there.
  
* [Mark Mahoney: Version Control Optimized for Teaching and Learning](https://vimeo.com/97711978)
  * it's like seperate conversations for every change of code. So it's like github pull request reviews but on steriods.
  * You can get character by character playback, so it's very much like google docs in that way
  * I admire his goal -- enhancing commit log and explaining code and evolution of system
  * This is related to my idea of putting the commit message first, reversing things, but in a much better and granular way. TODO write up my thoughts here, particularly how you can nest things in a workflowy style
  * wouldn't it be neat if you could query by certain kinds of changes, like adding regex's

* [Bill Burdick: Leisure](https://vimeo.com/97713914)
  * blurs the line between viewing and editing websites
  * "brings the chrome inspector more center stage"
  
* [David Broderick: Kaya: Declarative Reactive](https://vimeo.com/97712270)
  * seems like he'd be a fan of Eve
  
* https://github.com/lamdu/lamdu/
  * really wonderful explaination of many of hte main points of my thesis http://www.lamdu.org/ and https://medium.com/lamdu-blog/designing-programming-languages-with-ides-in-mind-de890989dfa
  * while I still don't really understand even what I'm installing (is it a terminal app or a GUI app), it took me over an hour to install Lamdu on Cloud9, fighting with apt-get, stack, and generally waiting for everything to download and install. Clearly they don't have a sufficient appreciate of the cloud-based nature part of my thesis.
  * I found this wonderful video showing it in action https://vimeo.com/97713439. This video is like Paul's early demo's of Unison but more extensive! I'm blown away. I can't believe I didn't find this sooner. I want to submit a pull request to get them to put this video on their main page. Ok, just did... https://github.com/lamdu/lamdu.github.io/pull/5
  * it's been hours and things still aren't done installing... just updated my c9 instance to have the max RAM and memory
  * More research in my journal here http://futureofcoding.org/journal#july-24-2017-204pm
  
* [A brief history of "type"](http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-brief-history-of-type.html?m=1)

* [Intentional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_programming)
  * I think this stuff is really interesting. If done right, it's similar to how google wants all of their code to be self-documenting. It's probably the exact opposite of Eve's literate programming approach where the code and explaination are two seperate things that humans need to keep in sync.
  * Personally, I find functional programming hard to read / parse meaning from. TODO think about ways we could make FP more readable
  * TODO think about what it would be like to define an entire program in a high-level language and then have to specific the macros to intepret each expression, potentially with Woof. Think about how to zoom in and out on various lines.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch_limit
  * not to be taken seriously. at a worst case, we can put text into visual programming to add density, but density isn't that important after all because we have encapsulation.

* [Additional Notes on "Drawing Dynamic Visualizations"](http://worrydream.com/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum/)
  * really amazing, inspirational demos! Makes me wonder how Scratch could be more like this and less about the code
    * TODO brainstorm what would be a intuative interface for a student to program gravity from scratch
  * Seems similar to aprt.us, which makes sense because Bret steals from Toby's Recursive Drawing project
  * TODO think about ways to tackle the context problem, helping programmers point to what they want

* [Always bet on text](http://graydon.livejournal.com/196162.html)
  * text is great for many reasons. I think less so for communicating with comptuers

* [How to Invent the Future I - Alan Kay](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/11) 
  * email him - he loves email!
  * read "the dream machine" about xerox parc / arpa
  * sketchpad is interesting. does object-oriented programming well: master vs instances
    * read ivan sutherland 1962 thesis - man machine communication thesis
  * really great advise on running research community
    * vision, not goals
    * fund people, not projects
    * research community, not research project
    * fund problem finding, not just problem solving
    * milestones, not deadlines
    * be ok with high failure rate
    * just two years for the person running the group
    * solve the problem, don't think about what you can do with the tools you have. make the tools if you need to
    * argue for clarity, not to win
    * keep tabs on people in the "minor leagues"
  * send alan kay about email about learning to communicate with Aliens from integalactic email memo from "Lick"
