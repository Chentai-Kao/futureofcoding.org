# 26 - Compassion & Programming: Glen Chiacchieri

_07/03/18_

Glen Chiacchieri has worked at the MIT Media Lab on Scratch, at [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) with Bret Victor, and is now becoming a psychotherapist. He's known for his [Legible Mathematics](http://glench.com/LegibleMathematics/) essay, his [Flowsheets](https://tinyletter.com/Flowsheets/archive) programming prototypes, and the [Laser Socks](http://glench.com/LaserSocks/) game, among many other projects.

In this conversation, we discuss:

* how he grounds his research in compassion,
* the tradeoffs between working on the "model vs UI" of programming, 
* his software-company-in-the-making, based on Flowsheets, 
* our shared dream for the future of open-source READMEs,  
* and how Dynamicland does and does not point towards the future.
