# Future of Coding Community

_Are you looking for [the **real** computer revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYT2se94eU0)? Join the club!_

You can join the [Future of Coding Slack community right here](https://join.slack.com/t/futureofcoding/shared_invite/zt-8vhwkhg2-rKZkVYJRKTwLbumJWVNaSw). If this link doesn't work on your mobile device, try it on a computer. Our community is open to any topic related to the evolution of computing, we have moderators and a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct), and you are heartily encouraged to share your personal projects. We also have a [Matrix bridge](#matrix-bridge).

While we all share the same basic assumption that programming can be improved, that’s about all we agree on. There’s the [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com) Fan club, the [Jonathan Edwards](https://alarmingdevelopment.org) school of thought, the Haskellers, the Smalltakers, and the compile-to-JavaScripters. Some of us are wild about direct manipulation, others believe we’ll be stuck with text forever, and yet others try to bring both together with projectional editors. Some believe in message-passing, others in the actor model, and others yet in various flavors of functional programming. And don’t even get me started on the divide between the interpreters vs the compilers, static vs dynamic typing. The debates are deep and wonderful, with an eye to half-forgotten history and a head filled with dreams of what could someday be.

## Getting Started

When you first join, we invite you to tell us all about yourself and your work in the #introductions channel. Please, no links to startups unless you also provide something deeply technical or otherwise interesting for us to talk about.

If you'd like to read up a bit on the ideas our community was formed around, [Chris Novello's _Computer Utopias_ curriculum](http://chrisnovello.com/teaching/risd/computer-utopias/) (particularly Week 3 & 4) and [The New Media Reader](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-media-reader) are fantastic resources.

This is a public, archived Slack, so treat it as a public record. For example, it is publicly accessible [here now](https://observablehq.com/@stevekrouse/future-of-coding-slack-search) and maybe in other places in the future.

## Threading

This slack discusses nuanced topics, so we have a strong preference for organizing conversations by thread. If you want to respond to someone, please respond in the thread of that message, and not with another top-level message.

- On desktop, hover over the message and in the little floating toolbar that appears, click "Start a thread" or "Reply to thread".
- On mobile, simply tap the message to open the thread view.

When you have something to share, try to post it as a single message (rather than posting several messages in quick succession) so that it's easier to start a thread of replies. You can create newlines with `shift-enter`. It's helpful to draft longer messages in your text editor of choice, and then paste them into Slack when you're ready to post.

## Channels

### #introductions

Tell us about your background, how you got into these topics, and why you joined the Slack. Feel free to share past project URLs and tag other members you know.

### #general

Share interesting links you've found and want to spark a discussion over. Ask questions, or `/poll` the crowd.

### #feedback

Share your own projects for high fives or feedback (after reading the [etiquette for sharing your own work](#sharing-your-own-work))

### #meta

Discuss ways to better collaborate, improve this Slack, or resolve community issues. This is place to propose the creation of new channels.

### #1-on-1s

Every 4 weeks, @donut will randomly pair everyone in this channel for 1-on-1 conversations. It's a good way to get to know others in the Slack.

### #jobs

Post if you are hiring or looking for work. Work related to the future of coding is preferred but all paid opportunities are allowed. Don't post more than once every couple of months about yourself or your company.

## Origin Story

This community was started by Irvin Hwang as a Google Group in mid-2017 for organizing NYC meetups, but was quickly turned into a Slack and taken over by Steve Krouse when Irvin got busy with his job, and then passed to the current steward Ivan Reese when Steve got busy with his life. You'll recognize Ivan's profile pic because it's a dang pizza for a face.

## Matrix Bridge
Our 4 most popular channels are bridged to Matrix rooms. They should be accessible in any Matrix client using the following aliases:

* #_slack_futureofcoding_general:matrix.org
* #_slack_futureofcoding_feedback:matrix.org
* #_slack_futureofcoding_introductions:matrix.org
* #_slack_futureofcoding_random:matrix.org

You can also search for "Future of Coding" in a Matrix client to find them. Thanks to [J. Ryan Stinnett](https://twitter.com/jryans) for facilitating these.
