<h1>Future of Coding Community</h1>

The Future of Coding Slack is loosely connected to the Future of Coding podcast. People hear about it there and sometimes discuss episodes -- but it's only one of many common touch points for the community, including Bret Victor, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Fred Brooks, HCI, HARC, Eve... For a fuller list of relevant people, topics, and links, check out [Chris Novello's _Computer Utopias_ curriculum](http://chrisnovello.com/teaching/risd/computer-utopias/) (particularly Week 3 & 4) and [The New Media Reader](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-media-reader).

## Getting Started

On desktop, you can [join the Slack here](http://futureofcoding.org/slack-link). The link doesn't work on mobile for some reason.

Upon joining the Slack, you get this automated message:

ðŸ‘‹ welcome welcome @new\_user\_name! Head over to the Future of Coding Slack README for a 5 minute intro futureofcoding.org/slack-readme

So if you are reading this message, congrats on following the instructions!

1. Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel (after reading the [style guide](https://futureofcoding.org/community#style-guide))
2. Join the relevant channels
3. Be kind and have fun!

## Purposes

The purposes of the Future of Coding Slack are:

1. Sharing of ideas, debate, feedback, constructive criticism, and collaboration

2. Encouragement, high fives

3. Organizing IRL meetings and meetups

## Channels

### #introductions

Tell us about your background, how you got into these topics, and why you joined the Slack. Feel free to share past project URLs and tag other members you know.

### #general

- Share interesting links you&#39;ve found and want to spark a discussion over
- Ask questions or /poll the crowd
- Share your own projects for high fives or feedback (after reading the etiquette for sharing your own work)

### #meta

Discuss ways to better collaborate, improve this Slack, or resolve community issues. This is place to propose the creation of new channels.

### #1-on-1s

Every 4 weeks, @donut will randomly pair everyone in this channel for 1-on-1 conversations. It&#39;s a good way to get to know others in the Slack.

### #jobs

Post if you are hiring or looking for work. Work related to the future of coding is preferred but all paid opportunities are allowed. Don't post more than once every couple of months about yourself or your company.

### Locations

- #nyc
- #london
- #boston
- #kitchener-waterloo
- #sf

### Topics

- #graphics
- #music
- #research-center
- #robust-computation
- #category-theory

## Style Guide

### Threading

This slack discusses nuanced topics, so we have a strong preference for organizing conversations by thread. If you want to respond to someone, respond in the thread of that message. Do not respond with another top-level message.

When creating a top-level message, try to create it in a single message so that it's easier to thread off it. You can create newlines with shift-enter. It's helpful to draft longer messages in your personal channel @yourname channel.

### Sharing your own work

When sharing your own work, start the post with &quot;\*Show FoC:\*&quot;

If you&#39;re asking for feedback, start the post with &quot;\*Feedback request:\*&quot; and specify the both the goal/motivation for the project (to avoid the [XY Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem)) and for the kind of feedback you want:

- advice on a specific issue
- advice on overall strategy
- nitpicking spellcheck
- high fives

## Origin Story

This community was started by Irvin Hwang as a Google Group in mid-2017 for organizing NYC meetups, but was quickly turned into a Slack and taken over by Steve Krouse when Irvin got busy with his job.
