# Community

We share and discuss ideas, prototypes, weekly demo videos, and inspirational links, with a friendly tone and an inclusive [code of conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct). We also organize meetups and events in cities around the world and online. The discussions are deep and wonderful, with an eye to half-forgotten history and a head filled with dreams of what could someday be.

You can join the [Future of Coding Slack community right here](https://join.slack.com/t/futureofcoding/shared_invite/zt-8vhwkhg2-rKZkVYJRKTwLbumJWVNaSw). If this link doesn't work on your mobile device, try it on a computer. Our community is open to any topic related to the evolution of computing. We also have a [Matrix bridge](#matrix-bridge).

This is a public, archived Slack, so treat it as a public record. For example, it is publicly accessible [here now](https://observablehq.com/@stevekrouse/future-of-coding-slack-search) and maybe in other places in the future.

## Channels

### #introductions
Tell us about your background, how you got into these topics, and why you joined the Slack. Feel free to share past project URLs and tag other members you know. Please, no links to startups, unless you also provide something deeply technical, philosophical, or otherwise interesting for us to talk about.

### #general
Share interesting links you've found and want to spark a discussion over. Ask questions, or `/poll` the crowd.

### #two-minute-week
Once each week, post a 2-minute (max) video explaining your most recent progress on your project. [Learn More](/two-minute-week)

### #feedback
Share your own projects, blog posts, or detailed concepts. We'll give them constructive feedback.

### #meta
Discuss ways to better collaborate, improve this Slack, or resolve community issues.

### #1-on-1s
Every 4 weeks, @donut will randomly pair everyone in this channel for 1-on-1 conversations. It's a good way to get to know others in the Slack.

### #jobs
Post if you are hiring or looking for work. Work related to the future of coding is preferred but all paid opportunities are allowed. Don't post more than once every couple of months about yourself or your company.

### #random
Have something cool to share that doesn't quite feel on-topic? Our random channel is a great place to enthuse about interesting things that are only distantly related, or perhaps not related at all, to the future of coding.

<br>

There are a handful of other channels, focussed on meetups and subject-specific discussion. When you first arrive, be sure to check them out and join the ones that fit your interests.

Note that we likely aren't going to add any new subject-specific channels, as they tend to all become ghost towns. But if you have an idea for a fun kind of activity we could do together in a new channel — something like #two-minute-week — propose it in #meta!

## Threading
This slack discusses nuanced topics, so we have a strong preference for organizing conversations by thread. If you want to respond to someone, please respond in the thread of that message, and not with another top-level message.

- On desktop, hover over the message and in the little floating toolbar that appears, click "Start a thread" or "Reply to thread".
- On mobile, simply tap the message to open the thread view.

When you have something to share, try to post it as a single message (rather than posting several messages in quick succession) so that it's easier to start a thread of replies. You can create newlines with `shift-enter`. It's helpful to draft longer messages in your text editor of choice, and then paste them into Slack when you're ready to post.

## Matrix Bridge
Our 4 most popular channels are bridged to Matrix rooms. They should be accessible in any Matrix client using the following aliases:

* [#_slack_futureofcoding_general:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#_slack_futureofcoding_general:matrix.org)
* [#_slack_futureofcoding_feedback:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#_slack_futureofcoding_feedback:matrix.org)
* [#_slack_futureofcoding_introductions:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#_slack_futureofcoding_introductions:matrix.org)
* [#_slack_futureofcoding_random:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#_slack_futureofcoding_random:matrix.org)

You can also search for "Future of Coding" in a Matrix client to find them. Thanks to [J. Ryan Stinnett](https://twitter.com/jryans) for facilitating these.
