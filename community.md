# Community

We share and discuss ideas, prototypes, weekly demo videos, and inspirational links, with a friendly tone and an inclusive [code of conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct). We also organize meetups and events in cities around the world and online. The discussions are deep and wonderful, with an eye to half-forgotten history and a head filled with dreams of what could someday be.

Before joining the community, please familiarize yourself with the [member handbook](/member-handbook).

You can join the [Future of Coding Slack community right here](https://join.slack.com/t/futureofcoding/shared_invite/zt-8vhwkhg2-rKZkVYJRKTwLbumJWVNaSw). If this link doesn't work on your mobile device, try it on a computer. Our community is open to any topic related to furthering the evolution of computing. We also have a [Matrix bridge](#matrix-bridge).

You can explore the archives of our Slack using this [History Search](http://history.futureofcoding.org) tool (h/t to [Mariano Guerra](https://marianoguerra.github.io)).
