# Future of Coding Research Journal

### July 13, 2017 2:13pm

Welcome to the first entry of the Future of Coding Research Journal!

The tone of this journal will be stream-of-consciousness. First and foremost, it is for me to work through my own thoughts. If it can be helpful to people on the interwebs, even better!

To recap the state of affairs, I've been working on building "next generation" programming languages on-and-off for about a year now. You can read more about my past research and prototypes here:

</ul>

Today I'm simply creating this journal and seeding it with some basic content. Here's what I want to think about next time I'm here (either tomorrow or Monday): what to work on next.

Here are some ideas, in no particular order, but numbered so I can refer to them via their number:

1. Build an Elm game engine
2. Build a reactive version of WoofJS
3. Finish building my Elm Spelling Bee App
5. Reach out to Luna Lang to get access
6. Spend more time with Lambdu
7. Organize [links of other resources in this space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TtfMqBBRGnwisCx42nuXa4Y5VF3EizpZxFQBivJWhhE/edit) 
8. Re read rose blogs
9. Prune with text as ui

Clearly, I should start with (8) because it will help me come up with other things to work on. Until next time!
