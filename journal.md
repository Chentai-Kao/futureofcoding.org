# Future of Coding Research Journal

### July 14, 2017 2:58pm

I'm back! So a few things on my mind.

Firstly, organizing my thoughts on what to research next from yesterday. Another one to add to the list: 

10. Thinking about how Woof, or the next step after Woof, could be the starting point for Rose. Use my students as my target user and build for them.

Secondly, I think it would be good for my audience to hear about my past research so they have context before I go off explaining my new research. Potentially reviewing past research could even be a good way for me to decide what to research next. Ok, so at first I thought this would be a recap in one episode but now I'm realizing it might span multiple episodes. Here are the topics to discuss:

- Scratch, how it's amazing (types as shapes, cloud based, no syntax errors, no documentation, no runtime errors, good abstractions like forever's running once per render loop, audio and image editors, social network, allow kids to make what they want)
- I was inspired to build blocks for JQuery, Cycle version 1. No HTML, No CSS. You would do everything imperitively. It would compile to JS directly. Stopped working on it when I found Code.org App Lap. 
- Took a break to work on the business and Woof which I'll discuss later.
- Came back to build blocks for VueJS, which is very similar to ReactJS. Much more declarative.
  - build TodoMVC
  - built a chat app, weather app
  - fun to work with, faster and easier than coding
  - terrible error messages
  - brittle
  - used with students, went to hackathons
    - harder to learn than I thought it would be (the abstractions could be clearer, but hard to do that within blockly)
    - error messages were a killer
    - the fact that you could import into it or export from it was bad considering it couldn't be self contained 
- Rebranded as Rose
  - worked on Prune, projectional editing in JS because importable and exportable
    - providing users will all possible semantic edits is tricky
    - js is a shitty language so even if we solve all syntax errors, the abstractions are tough and there are runtime errors
  - if I were to go back to prune, I would leave the text as the UI (not Vue) and just focus on a subset of JS (so no import)
- Research into other products
  - Elm. Really tricky to use but amazing once you get it running.
  - Cycle. Similar to Elm. Streams are nifty.
  - Eve. Clearly I should spend more time with it but still doesn't make sense to me.
  - Unison. Very exciting. Seems like it's almost exactly what I want in so many ways. Hope to get my friend Paul on here soon.
  - Luna Lang / Lambdu - need to spend more time with these
  - List of others... needs organizing and time

- Woof
  - next step after Scratch
  - one-to-one mapping of blocks, so leverage understanding of Scratch to learn text-based coding in JS
  - enable game development
  - full integreated IDE
  - open source and free, so hit me up on github if you'd like to contribute

- directions for going in next (below) 

Ok, so that is a lot of content. Obviously. Especially if I want to drill into each of these topics. Let's estimate how much time each topics will take.

- Scratch is amazing (10 min)
- Blocks for JQuery (10 min)
- Blocks for VueJS (20 min)
- Rose / Prune (20 min)
- Other ressearch (20 min)
- The story of Woof (15 min)
- Next steps (20 min)

Ok, so it sounds like I really could do it in a long solo podcast. It would be an interesting experience. I may end up wanting more control than the tryca.st editor gives me so I can pause it, do a do-over, etc. Let's try it all as one take and see how it goes... I wonder if talking about my next steps will be cogent at all or if I'm going to prefer to write about it first and then talk about it.

Welcome to the first entry of the Future of Coding Research Journal!

The tone of this journal will be stream-of-consciousness. First and foremost, it is for me to work through my own thoughts. If it can be helpful to people on the interwebs, even better!

To recap the state of affairs, I've been working on building "next generation" programming languages on-and-off for about a year now. You can read more about my past research and prototypes here:

</ul>

Today I'm simply creating this journal and seeding it with some basic content. Here's what I want to think about next time I'm here (either tomorrow or Monday): what to work on next.

Here are some ideas, in no particular order, but numbered so I can refer to them via their number:

1. Build an Elm game engine
2. Build a reactive version of WoofJS
3. Finish building my Elm Spelling Bee App
5. Reach out to Luna Lang to get access
6. Spend more time with Lambdu
7. Organize [links of other resources in this space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TtfMqBBRGnwisCx42nuXa4Y5VF3EizpZxFQBivJWhhE/edit) 
8. Re read rose blogs
9. Prune with text as ui

Clearly, I should start with (8) because it will help me come up with other things to work on. Until next time!
